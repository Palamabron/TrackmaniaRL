> Update 2026-10-08 07:22 UTC — repair search reorganized around decisions; calibration trajectory COMPLETE.
>
> Central entry point: [SD_SAC_REPAIR_DECISIONS.md](SD_SAC_REPAIR_DECISIONS.md), with closed hypotheses, fixed budgets and decision/stop rules. Existing scheduler instructions shortened to current state and durable constraints; no more unrelated audits or grids at each wakeup. One checkpoint load now collects complementary trajectory metrics and reason groups.
>
> Fixed weight0/.01, seeds17/29,48steps each:192 copied steps,212.36s; all four endpoints EXACTLY reproduce prior calibration. Both weight0.01 seeds first fail held nonterminal MAE guard at sampled step8. Final held MAE0.113856/0.115229, MSE0.095405/0.090436 versus initial0.071385/0.033756; fit nonterminal MSE also worsens. Held clipped loss worsens alongside MAE. Terminal MAE improves to4.550828/4.597501. This supports a finite calibration tradeoff, not merely metric disagreement or ordinary train-only overfit; no optimizer/clipping bug is established. Close further generic weighting/initial-optimizer tweaks; no early promotion.
>
> Original actual CP SHA/model/target/all optimizers unchanged; pins/STOP valid, both captured exact processes closed. Ruff/mypy PASS. Evidence calibration-trajectory.json plus receipts/verification and repair-state.json under evidence/sd-projlr08-final. No runtime learner/controller/pilot; full SD BLOCKED.
>
> Concrete next hypothesis and causal/control/scope contract prepared in [SD_SAC_OBSERVABILITY_PROPOSAL.md](SD_SAC_OBSERVABILITY_PROPOSAL.md). SD-SAC-only remaining-clock adapter requires explicit widening of the current no-observation/model/architecture-change scope. No dependent experiment before that decision; keep heartbeat ACTIVE5min and quiet on unchanged pending state.

> Update 2026-10-08 07:14 UTC — critic Adam-direction audit COMPLETE; zero optimizer/model/runtime steps.
>
> Same calibration episode split/frozen targets as the prior gradient audit. Non-mutating saved/fresh/zero-first-moment Adam algebra for empirical-frequency baseline and baseline plus previously tested normalized terminal weight0.01. Reason-specific additions weighted by their fit-terminal prevalence sum to the total terminal addition (invariant PASS). Eight independent float64 scalar Adam algebra controls PASS, including bias correction, weight decay and AMSGrad; no synthetic optimizer step was executed. Frozen SD-SAC _optimize has no gradient clipping to reproduce here.
>
> All15 initial analytic tangent directions have negative derivatives for held nonterminal clipped loss/MSE/MAE and held terminal MSE/MAE. Saved baseline nonterminal-MAE derivative -0.00031489; with terminal0.01 -0.00070291; terminal-MAE -0.00068902 -> -0.01854663. Fresh/zero-first-moment directions also improve locally. Thus neither initial raw gradient conflict nor initial Adam momentum reversal explains the observed later calibration drift; no optimizer reset or runtime change is justified. These are infinitesimal directional predictions, not executed finite steps or driving evidence.
>

> Update 2026-10-08 07:02 UTC — clock/timeout semantics control COMPLETE; zero optimizer/runtime updates.
>
> Frozen reward and environment intentionally implement maximum_race_time_s as a penalized terminal; collection/telemetry interruptions are separate truncations. Three existing focused tests PASS: penalized race deadline, terminal zero bootstrap, truncation preserving bootstrap. SD-SAC target construction respects the replay discount. Automatic time-limit-to-truncation relabeling would change the tested task objective and is rejected.
>
> Actual frozen V5 feature transform on two synthetic identical-motion histories with clock pairs0/149900ms then50/149950ms produces exactly identical context/physics/recovery/track tensors (all max errors0). This establishes clock-shift information loss for this control, not an exact alias observed in replay and not failure causality.

Short foreground control ended before capture; no exact PID/ctime claim. Pytest emitted only the documented unknown cache_dir option warning with cacheprovider disabled;3passed.
>
> Next scoped zero-update diagnostic: critic parameter-gradient alignment by terminal reason (including time_limit) versus ordinary nonterminal Bellman loss, to understand why earlier terminal calibration worsened general estimates. Inspect existing harness before loading; no optimizer updates, runtime promotion, architecture changes or blind coefficient grid. ACTIVE5min; full SD BLOCKED.

> Update 2026-10-08 06:57 UTC — terminal-history observability audit COMPLETE; zero optimizer/runtime updates.
>
> Frozen coordinator intentionally retains only behavior entropy in online replay info. First diagnostic found all terminal-reason/history metadata absent; its output is preserved. Extended diagnostic joins all130 terminal rows to train/episode events by exact episode name and asserts episode steps=row step+1. Previous transition links/episode/step continuity also PASS, but causal pre-action progress counters are absent from replay, so no counter-conditioned fit is claimed.
>
> Matched endpoint reasons:69 no_progress,37 slow_progress,24 time_limit. Both-critic terminal-reward MAE: no_progress4.2454/4.2379, slow_progress4.6690/4.6947, time_limit10.5076/10.5670. Time-limit rows contribute35.18% of total absolute meanQ terminal error despite18.46% of terminal rows. No-progress endpoints all have steps_since=100; slow-progress window predicates PASS. Endpoint metadata is post-action and cannot be used as current-observation input.
>
> Frozen V5 observation shapes/context/recovery layouts and V2 motion construction omit explicit reward no-progress age, reward progress-window aggregate and absolute race time. They include frame advance and decaying incident memory, which are different signals. This omission does not establish non-identifiability from other features, a causal explanation of failed driving, or permission to alter shared model/reward/GNN/replay.

## 2026-10-08 — fixed combination fits starts but fails greedy-regret protection

The standalone all-state margin probe completed 384 steps in87.47s: coefficient0.1 improves general held reverse-KL to0.09108/0.09931, but both seeds still miss all starts. The subsequent fixed0.25-start-loss plus0.1-margin combination fits all27 held-episode starts in both seeds. General held forward-KL0.06339/0.06397 and reverse-KL0.09081/0.09135 pass the matched-control limits, but greedy regret0.00082685/0.00091310 exceeds both ordinary and margin-only 20% drift guards. The combination is rejected for runtime promotion; start success alone is insufficient. This is frozen-Q diagnostic evidence, not driving or a validated critic.

All original checkpoint/model/Adam pins, actual SHA, STOP and exact owned-process closure checks pass. Evidence includes `greedy-margin.json`, `start-margin-combination.json`, their verification files, and `greedy-tradeoff-rows.json` in `evidence/sd-projlr08-final`. The paired row analysis identifies where greedy regret worsens without rereading or updating any model. Next inspect replay metadata for those rows and recurring action/context tradeoffs before another candidate. Full SD remains BLOCKED; no new pilot is launched.

## 2026-10-08 — repeated greedy-margin reversal; auxiliary probe pending

The matched trajectory audit completed 384 disposable actor steps in 202.56 seconds. Both ordinary-fit seeds reach 100% held-start agreement at step48 and lose it by step64, while general held reverse-KL improves from about0.20 to0.125. The 0.25 mixture has no correct start mode at the sampled trace points; start-only fits starts but fails general calibration. Ordinary endpoints reproduce prior metrics within1e-6. Original checkpoint/model/Adam, exact process closure, pins and STOP verified. This supports a soft-distribution-versus-greedy-mode fitting tradeoff on these saved data, not critic correctness or a driving fix.

A new bounded offline hypothesis is PENDING: an all-state greedy-margin hinge added to the unchanged ordinary forward-KL plus behavior entropy anchor. It uses only the original ordinary fit rows (no added start sampling), detached mean-Q top action and soft-target top-two gap capped at0.1 log-probability, ignores tied Q maxima, coefficients0/.01/.1, seeds17/29,64steps (384total), cap300s. Five numerical hinge invariants and Ruff/mypy pass. Require both seeds 100% held-start agreement AND general held forward-KL/reverse-KL/regret <=1.2xmatched ordinary baseline; preserve all results. No runtime change or new pilot authorized by partial CPU fit; Full remains BLOCKED.

## 2026-10-08 — intermediate actor-margin trajectories pending

A bounded CPU single-thread diagnostic is running on disposable saved-Adam actor copies: ordinary fitting, 0.25 start-loss mixture and start-only fitting, seeds17/29, 64 steps each (384 total), fixed 300-second copy-compute cap. It records intermediate held start margins against actions8/56 and general held calibration at steps0/1/4/8/16/32/48/64. The endpoints already have evidence; the new purpose is to locate the reversal that the zero-update direction audit cannot explain. No new mixture fraction, runtime setting, controller, critic update or persisted model is introduced. Result PENDING; no pilot promotion from partial fitting.

## 2026-10-08 — saved-Adam direction and start-margin audit

The zero-update CPU audit completed in 8.67 seconds. The analytic Adam displacement matches PyTorch on eight numerical controls (saved/fresh state, weight decay and AMSGrad). With ordinary fitting, saved Adam gives a negative local target35-versus8 margin derivative (-0.000995); fresh Adam and clearing only the first moment make it positive (+0.04402/+0.00740). However, all six combinations of ordinary/start-only fitting and saved/fresh/cleared-first-moment Adam worsen target35 versus action56 locally. Even start-only fitting does so initially, although the completed 64-step start-only probe eventually selects35. Lower held start loss therefore does not imply an immediate greedy-margin improvement. These are first-order directional measurements, not actual finite-step outcomes, and do not justify resetting Adam or launching a pilot.

Original checkpoint SHA, model and Adam remain unchanged; all captured exact identities are closed, episode rows match, pins and STOP pass. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/adam-directions.json` and verification. Full SD remains BLOCKED. Next inspect intermediate finite-step margins on matched ordinary, 0.25-mixture and start-only disposable copies to locate the reversal and interference; do not expand the mixture grid blindly.

## 2026-10-08 — zero-update actor gradient audit

The CPU single-thread audit completed in 7.05 seconds with zero optimizer steps. At the original saved actor, tangent gradient cosine is +0.44116 for ordinary fit versus fit starts, +0.42375 for fit starts versus general held rows, and approximately 1 for fit versus held starts. Nine parameter tensors nevertheless have negative tangent dot products (listed in verification); the aggregate result does not support a global initial gradient-conflict explanation. These local gradients are not saved-Adam steps and do not establish compatibility after finite updates or driving quality.

Episode rows match the completed mixture probe. Actual checkpoint SHA, original model and Adam are unchanged; immutable pins and STOP checks pass. The audit exited normally before identity capture; verification records session exit 0 and an empty matching-process inventory, without claiming captured exact identities. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/gradient-conflict.json` and its verification. No new pilot is justified; Full SD remains BLOCKED. Next inspect saved-Adam preconditioning and action-margin directional derivatives without optimizer steps before choosing further fitting experiments.

## 2026-10-08 — completed start-loss mixture diagnostic

The bounded offline probe completed all 384 disposable actor steps in 160.48 seconds. Fractions 0.01, 0.1 and 0.25 passed all general held forward-KL, reverse-KL and greedy-regret limits against their matched ordinary-fit baseline, but every fraction and both seeds retained 0% held-start agreement. No tested fraction qualifies. Lower start fitting error alone does not justify a runtime change or a new pilot.

Original checkpoint SHA, models and saved Adam remain unchanged; both exact owned processes are closed, all immutable pins are valid, and no new STOP is present. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-start-mixture.json` and its verification. Full SD training remains BLOCKED. Next: inspect parameter-gradient conflict between start and ordinary fitting losses with a zero-update CPU diagnostic before selecting any further fitting experiment. Do not repeat or extend the completed grid.

## 8 October 2026 05:36 UTC - start-fit capacity/exposure control complete

Dedicated fit to104 fit-episode starts completed128 projected saved-Adam actor steps in27.30s,seeds17/29,LR.0009,forward-KL,unchanged alpha.01 and behavior entropy anchor. Both copies reach100% mean-Q greedy agreement(action35,gas1) on all27 held-episode starts,zero greedy regret,forwardKL.010035/reverseKL.016348. The actor can fit this saved initial-state preference;short mixed-probe failure does not establish an architecture/capacity bottleneck. Held starts are similar observations already encountered during original training,not unseen real driving.

General held replay reverseKL increases from original.471377 to.716892/.716887 despite forwardKL declining.375595 to.329989/.329986 and greedy regret declining.008611 to.005998. Start-only fitting therefore loses general distribution calibration and is not a runtime candidate. No proof that frozen Q values are correct,no driving claim,no model/reward/GNN/replay change.

Original checkpoint/model/Adam unchanged,actualSHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,all exact owned probe processes closed,immutable pins valid,no changed STOP.

Next offline diagnostic may test a fixed mixed/start loss-mixture grid .01/.1/.25 on disposable projected actor/savedAdam copies,paired seeds64steps,against the completed ordinary mixed fit. Require held-start agreement and both-seed general-held forwardKL/reverseKL/greedy-regret no more than20% worse than the matched ordinary-mixed result. This tests a fitting tradeoff only;no automatic runtime replay reweighting or fresh pilot until scoped evidence is reviewed.

## 8 October 2026 05:32 UTC - zero-update start coverage audit

The diagnostic fit sample contains3 episode-first observations out of2048(.1465%),held sample1/512. With128 draws per step and64 steps,the fit distribution yields12 expected start draws per copy. This quantifies limited exposure in the short offline probe;it does not reconstruct or establish insufficient start sampling in actual training. Saved replay has131 starts among145424 transitions. All131 starts form9 exact decoded observation hashes with small context/physics differences;none of the sampled nonstart rows exactly aliases any start. This is a sampled exact-identity check,not proof of a fully Markov representation or absence of near-aliases.

Original actor start top action8 probability.032694 with top-two gap.0005497. Mean-Q soft target top action35 probability.058295,second action56 probability.047109,gap.011187;Q gap.002131,alpha.01,soft entropy4.05041. Thus the target has an identifiable gas-action preference despite high entropy. Shared no-gas choices after short mixed-sample copy fitting cannot alone establish inability to represent the start preference.

New audit_sd_sac_start_coverage.py: Ruff/boundary-scoped mypy pass,real CPUidle1thread inference completed,zero optimizer/controller updates,checkpoint fingerprint/SHA/model immutability verified. Immutable source pins valid/no changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/start-coverage.json. No offline process running,no new pilot,fullBLOCKED,automationACTIVE5min. Next bounded offline capacity/exposure control: fit disposable projected actor copies to fit-episode start rows directly against unchanged mean-Q/alpha/behavior anchor,compare held-episode starts and general held rows;paired seeds,savedAdam,strict fixed cap. This is a representation/fitting diagnostic,not permission to alter replay sampling or claim driving improvement.

## 8 October 2026 05:25 UTC - fresh-Adam control complete; no objective promotion

The paired fresh-Adam control completed512 projected actor-copy steps in113.53s. AtLR.0009,SAC held reverseKL.078282/.072759 is close to forward-KL.075557/.074223; SAC greedy agreement64.65/64.84% remains below forward76.76/76.37%,and greedy regret.000963/.000879 exceeds forward.000522/.000596. Resetting disposable optimizer history removes much of the saved-Adam SAC deficit,so the earlier inherited-Adam comparison cannot establish that SAC is intrinsically worse.

Both fresh objectives atLR.0009 choose action56(no gas) on all131 saved starts,with zero agreement against mean-Q greedy action35(gas1) and regret.002131; atLR.0001 both choose action3,also zero agreement. Neither comparison supports an objective-only runtime fix or another identical fast-actor pilot. Reused replay,frozen critics and only64 steps limit interpretation; no capacity/architecture conclusion or claim about driving.

Original CP/model/Adam unchanged,all exact probe processes closed,actual CP SHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,immutable pins valid,no changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-objectives-fresh-adam.json and actor-objectives-fresh-adam-verification.json. No offline process remains,no new pilot launched,fullBLOCKED,automationACTIVE5min. Next zero-update diagnostic: quantify start-state fit coverage,observation aliasing and actor/soft-target top-action probability margins; distinguish sampling/generalization from fitting ability before another optimizer probe.

## 8 October 2026 05:20 UTC - saved-Adam actor objective result and fresh control

All512 projected actor-copy steps completed in113.14s; original checkpoint/model/saved Adam unchanged,all exact probe identities closed,actual CP SHA and immutable pins valid,no changed STOP. On held episodes,forward-KL atLR.0009 gives agreement76.95/77.15%,regret.000536/.000518,reverseKL.124906/.124686. Canonical SAC at the same LR and inherited Adam gives agreement21.68/22.27%,regret.007336/.007167,reverseKL.653937/.608725 versus baseline.471377. AtLR.0001,SAC reverseKL.469171/.468223 barely improves baseline. All variants still have zero mean-Q greedy agreement on saved starts; no objective promoted and no new runtime pilot.

This is not a clean comparison of objectives trained from scratch: inherited Adam moments were accumulated under forward-KL,whose current local logit gradients are much larger. A paired fresh-Adam control is therefore now running with identical original actor,Q,alpha,entropy anchor,episode split,seeds,LR grid,64 steps per cell and projection. Explicit --adam-state fresh changes only disposable optimizer initialization; saved mode remains default. Output actor-objectives-fresh-adam.json is new,never overwrites saved-Adam evidence.

Evidence saved-Adam: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-objectives.json and actor-objectives-verification.json. Fresh-Adam results pending. Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass. No claim about critic truth,architecture bottleneck or driving from this reused-replay frozen-Q diagnostic. FullBLOCKED;automationACTIVE5min.

## 8 October 2026 05:16 UTC - actor objective copy comparison running

New diagnostic probe_sd_sac_actor_objectives.py compares forward-KL versus canonical SAC on identical frozen mean-Q,alpha,behavior entropy references and whole-episode fit/held rows. Each objective uses actorLR.0001/.0009 and seeds17/29,64 projected saved-Adam actor-copy steps per cell,512 total,300s copy-compute cap. Saved checkpoint/model/optimizer remain originals; no controller/runtime learner/new pilot. Fixed-Q fitting cannot establish critic correctness or driving.

Initial held logit gradients differ in magnitude and direction: forward norm.006390,SAC.00009552,cosine.76136. Unchanged entropy-anchor gradient relative norm is.00213 versus.14257. These are local logit gradients,not full parameter gradients or Adam step sizes; no conclusion about learning rate follows directly. Metrics include both KL directions,SAC objective,expected Q,greedy agreement/regret,entropy and per-row actions. Compare matched-seed/LR results only after completion; no objective promotion from partial results.

Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass. Existing objective helpers match runtime forward cross-entropy and canonical SAC up to a state-only Q baseline. Active CPU child80212 created1791436551.8764615 IDLE64,wrapper39824 created1791436551.862483. Exec66735,BASE/sd-projlr08-audit/actor-objectives.json and actor-objectives-processes.json. No duplicate execution or cap extension. Immutable source pins valid/no changed STOP. AutomationACTIVE5min; fullBLOCKED.

## 8 October 2026 05:12 UTC - projected terminal calibration rejected

Offline projected critic/saved-Adam copy probe completed all 384 steps in336.33s within600s cap. Both lambda0 baselines pass the held nonterminal drift guard. Every tested extra terminal weight(.01,.1,1) fails that guard in both seeds. At lambda.01,held terminal MAE improves from lambda0 4.994/5.013 to4.551/4.598,while held nonterminal MAE worsens to.113856/.115229 against the fixed limit.085662. Higher weights worsen nonterminal error further(.429/.434 and.913/1.159).

Whole-episode paired bootstrap with three-candidate family adjustment gives positive terminal-error reductions versus lambda0: .01 interval[.3456,.5213],.1[1.6123,2.2928],1[2.9242,4.7702]. Both-seed terminal gains also beat the initial baseline,but none qualifies because all nonzero weights fail the predeclared drift guard. This frozen-target reused-replay diagnostic does not establish driving quality; no terminal weighting promoted and no new pilot launched.

Final assertions confirm original checkpoint,models and saved Adam unchanged. Independent actual checkpoint SHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,all probe exactPID/ctime closed,immutable pins valid,no new/changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/projected-calibration.json and projected-calibration-verification.json. Full BLOCKED;automationACTIVE5min. Next scoped offline hypothesis: inspect actor objective gradients and compare projected forward-KL/canonical SAC copies against identical frozen mean-Q targets with episode-held rows and saved Adam. No runtime setting change justified yet.

## 8 October 2026 05:08 UTC - projected critic copy probe running

New standalone probe_sd_sac_projected_calibration.py is executing offline on CPU idle/single-thread against immutable CP33856 f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53. Only independent q1/q2 and saved critic Adam copies receive updates; saved actor,target critics,alpha and Bellman targets remain frozen. Projection after each copied Adam step; no Polyak update. No game controller/runtime learner/new training run.

Fixed whole-episode fit/held split, all available eligible terminal rows plus1024 sampled nonterminals per split. Stratified128+128 sampling restores empirical fit terminal prevalence for the clipped Bellman baseline; extra terminal MSE lambda0/.01/.1/1,seeds17/29,48 steps each,384 total,600s copy-compute cap. Baseline held terminal MAE5.01630,held nonterminal0.071385; relative20% guard<=0.085662. Both completed lambda0 copies pass guard and leave terminal error near baseline. Nonzero-grid result pending; do not infer success or launch a candidate from partial output.

Three focused numerical tests pass (empirical class weighting,explicit terminal contribution,clipped-versus-extra gradient). Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass. Process receipts and incremental results: BASE/sd-projlr08-audit/projected-calibration-processes.json and projected-calibration.json. AutomationACTIVE5min; poll existing execsession37505 or inspect recorded exactPID/ctime,never start a duplicate. Candidate interpretation requires both seed guards,held-terminal paired comparison against lambda0 and initial baseline,and original checkpoint/model/Adam immutability. Full remains BLOCKED.

## 8 October 2026 05:01 UTC - mean/min and target-clipping audit

Completed zero-update CPU idle/single-thread inference on both immutable projected checkpoints. The current mean-Q actor target ranks action35 (gas1) first on all131 saved starts; Q1 and Q2 individually rank no-gas actions56/62 first. Therefore the preceding no-gas finding for the individual critics does not mean their averaged actor target also prefers no gas. Mean-Q gas mass56.03%,best-gas advantage0.00213; min-Q gas mass51.00%,best-gas advantage-0.00176. Predecessor mean-Q gas mass93.77%,advantage0.02486. These are different saved replay states,not a paired causal comparison. Switching actor targets to min-Q is not supported as a fix for this failed start behavior.

Terminal clipping blocks the selected loss branch for only1/130 samples per critic (0.77%) in the current checkpoint,versus0/181 and1/181 previously. Nonterminal blocked fractions0%. This checkpoint snapshot does not explain terminal MAE5.53 through pervasive clipped gradients and cannot reconstruct historical gradients. Terminal bootstrap and mean-minus-min target gap are exactly0; terminal targets match immediate rewards. Nonterminal mean-minus-min target gap0.01718 on1024 rows,entropy bootstrap0.03785. These counterfactual targets do not establish true Q values.

New runnable audit: audit_sd_sac_target_calibration.py. Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass; two real CPU inference executions pass fingerprint/SHA/model immutability checks. Terminal-zero-bootstrap,target-equals-reward,and mean>=min invariants pass. No optimizer/controller/training run created. Evidence: [current](evidence/sd-projlr08-final/target-calibration.json),[predecessor](evidence/sd-projlr08-final/predecessor-target-calibration.json).

Next diagnostic remains offline: test whether projected disposable critic+savedAdam copies can reduce episode-held terminal error while preserving fixed nonterminal Bellman targets under a relative20% drift guard; include an unmodified-loss baseline and paired seeds. Earlier unprojected checkpoint weighting probes failed the guard; do not promote terminal weighting or claim an architecture bottleneck. Only a positive,repeatable scoped result can justify a fresh pilot. Current sd-projlr08 remains closed;full BLOCKED;automationACTIVE5min. No new controller launched.

## 8 October 2026 04:55 UTC - fast actor pilot failed; offline diagnosis

sd-projlr08 completed normally at04:50:06 UTC. Real evaluation: **0/10 finishes, mean progress1.060849%**, versus predecessor2/10 and51.558708%. All other gate checks passed: ten complete correct-UID trials,1446 valid timing measurements,max50ms,no controller/telemetry errors; skipped frames2906,max6. Full training remains BLOCKED. No next pilot launched.

Completed offline CPU idle/single-thread audits,zero runtime learner/controller updates:130 terminals MAE5.52922 (predecessor2.08577);944 analyzed nonterminals Bellman MAE0.06185 (predecessor0.08369). These are different saved replay samples,not a paired causal comparison. Critic pair greedy agreement on the sampled replay falls to5.20% from70.79%. On131 saved starts actor selects8,critic1 selects56,critic2/min selects62; all three are no-throttle timed-brake actions. Actor entropy4.25073; minQ margin0.06533; actor/minQ agreement0%. This is evidence against faster actor tracking as a sufficient repair,not proof of a capacity/architecture bottleneck.

Completed disposable saved-Adam actor probe64 steps per LR/seed,384 total,86.77s,checkpoint/model/Adam unchanged. Fixed averageQ held agreement23.24% initially; LR0.0001 gives25.00/25.00%,0.0003 gives25.20/24.61%,0.0009 gives76.95/77.15%.

Frozen-Q fitting improvements did not establish useful driving. Next step: offline inspect critic target/value calibration and mean-versus-min actor target before selecting a justified fresh plan. No terminal-weighting promotion,shared reward/model/GNN changes,resume,or reused-queue restart.

After “no to ogarnij to”, audited the preserved CP33866 in exact frozen e50b0b02,

was always action24=[gas0,brake0,steer-1/3], maxprob0.03947, entropy4.16891;
critic preferred56, agreement0%. This explains why this greedy policy can remain
stationary; the old evaluation did not persist issued commands, so actual backend
execution cannot be reconstructed. It was still a valid driving FAIL0/10.

All137 replay terminal states had mean Q12.368 vs reward-2.046, MAE14.414;
terminal fraction0.09418%, clipped loss blocked9.489% of terminal gradients.
Added explicit optional terminal_value_loss_coefficient (default0 preserves SD-SAC)
to anchor selected true-terminal actions directly to known rewards, normalized
within terminal samples, without bootstrap or clipping. Truncations excluded;
importance weights honored; checkpoint options prohibit changing this objective
on resume. It is an experimental critic objective, NOT a proven driving fix.
Added terminal TD error sum/count diagnostics and issued-control histogram,
measurement completeness and gas mean in future evaluation artifacts. Missing

Offline independent critic copies,200 CPU regression steps, fixed old bootstrap:

Head-only300step probe improved terminalMAE14.105 to13.992 only. Training-data
calibration and frozen targets cannot establish ranking, policy quality or driving.
113 CPU tests, Ruff and mypy passed. No saved model, reward, replay or frozen source
was edited; no game test, evaluation or new pilot launched. Evidence in
BASE/sd-sac-stability-no-movement-audit-20261006. FullSD BLOCKED; automation stays
PAUSED. Fresh training/test requires a new direct human instruction.

## 2026-10-06 17:30 Warsaw — evaluation completed; driving gate FAIL

This supersedes the earlier pre-evaluation failure and paused snapshot below.
After the human instruction “no to ogarniaj”, supervision was repaired and the
already authorized ten trials were completed on the preserved checkpoint,
without repeating training. New queue: queue-sd-sac-stability-eval-recovery01-20261006.
Evaluation ended 15:27:46.118406 UTC; guard normal closure 15:27:46.483867 UTC,
forced[]. All recorded PID/creation-time identities closed; shared mutex free.
W&B wwvg5ikp API finished. Original SAVE16:45:15/HARD16:55:15 UTC were retained.

Actual driving gate FAIL: 0/10 finishes; all trials no_progress, progress0.0%.
All ten trials used the correct map UID, 1000/1000 race-clock measurements valid,
maximum/p99 50ms, no controller or telemetry errors. Skips162 total, maximum4.
Complete training145466/145408,33866 updates, earned=accounted33866.5 and
credit0.5, finite/fingerprint-valid/drained checkpoint remains unchanged:
CP33866 SHA1428c80edfc05f5b341040aa39e6d051893b8c32d3b2648a667c048f5a94cb73.
Recovery performed zero learner updates. Frozen e50b0b02 source and helper hashes verified.
Evidence: the new queue's sd-sac-repair-decision.json, post-evaluation-receipt.json,
deadline-closure.json and actual benchmark evaluation.json.

Supervision repair f68cd0e2 adds bounded identity-aware polling of cached process
objects, avoiding wait-handle reopening; descendants now persist PID plus creation
time. Nine module tests and eleven recovery/supervision regression tests passed;
Ruff passed; type checking passed with only missing psutil stubs ignored.
The original AccessDenied OS cause remains unproven; no system process was modified.
The recovery completed under the repaired supervisor, but did not repair driving.

The experimental soft_q_forward_kl stability variant is NOT qualified for full
SD-SAC or three seeds. QR PASS29/30 median54.3s remains preserved.
Automation PAUSED after completion. No new pilot, training or evaluation without
another direct human instruction. Offline diagnosis may inspect why a single
unchanging action produced no progress; its cause is not yet demonstrated.

## Poprawki kodu SD-SAC po nowym poleceniu człowieka — 6 października 2026

## 2026-10-06 17:12 Warsaw — training complete; queue failed before evaluation

This supersedes the earlier active-pilot snapshot. The repaired experimental
SD-SAC stability pilot completed145466/145408 transitions and33866 updates.
Final CP33866 SHA1428c80edfc05f5b341040aa39e6d051893b8c32d3b2648a667c048f5a94cb73
is preserved. Read-only CPU validation in the exact frozen runtime confirmed
fingerprint match, finite learner state, earned=accounted33866.5 and credit0.5,
drained and complete. No learner was instantiated or updated for this validation.

Queue failed2026-10-06T15:12:40.466247UTC with `psutil.AccessDenied(pid59824)`
from `psutil.wait_procs` while checking descendant closure after training exited.
The exact OS-level cause is unproven. Guard normal closure15:12:40.945327UTC,
forced[], all pinned owned processes closed and shared controller mutex free.
Current PID59824 belongs to svchost; the old descendant creation-time identity
was not persisted. PID reuse is plausible but unproven, and that system process
was not modified. W&B ufoxma8r API finished. Original evidence/helpers,
checkpoint and original deadlines are unchanged. This queue is never restarted.

Driving evaluation NEVER STARTED: no evaluation YAML/history/artifact or driving
score. This is neither0/10 nor a gate PASS. Full SD-SAC remains BLOCKED, QR
PASS29/30 median54.3s preserved. No new pilot/training/evaluation was started.
Monitoring is being paused on completion of this report; a further test requires
new direct human authorization. Recommended offline harness repair: bounded
PID-and-creation-time liveness checks instead of waiting on disappeared process
handles; unknown live identities must continue to block controller handoff.

## 2026-10-06 14:55 Warsaw — one repaired experimental pilot active

Latest direct instruction: “Jak wszystko naprawisz odpal pilot SD SAC na nowo”.
The earlier human STOP and incomplete checkpoint are preserved; this is a new run
from zero, with no checkpoint or replay resume. Only this pilot and its ten greedy
evaluations are authorized; no automatic following pilot or full training.

Frozen source `e50b0b0216a658737209b99df6c1515e5367e625` at
`C:/Users/szulc/.codex/worktrees/tmrl-sd-sac-stability-runtime/AITrackmania`.
The explicit experimental variant uses soft-Q forward-KL actor fitting, actor
LR0.0003, temperature LR0.0001 and alpha bounds[0.01,0.2]. Target entropy0.8,
beta0.0005, critic LR0.0003, reward/map/model/GNN/replay/UTD remain unchanged.
Multiple stability controls change together; this pilot cannot isolate their
individual effects or establish canonical SD-SAC performance.

Code regressions: 93 CPU checks including the formerly skipped synthetic loops
passed, then the expanded behavior-entropy module (including both canonical and
forward-KL terminal learning and checkpoint round-trip) passed16 checks. Ruff
passed; 30 external guard/candidate/closure checks and validate-only passed.
This is code evidence, not driving qualification.

skips3120/max6; checkpoint SHA niezmieniony. Wszystkie warunki techniczne bramki
spełnione, jazda FAIL. Wynik target1.2 gorszy niż target.8 beta.0005 (48.4221%).

Audyt CPU exact frozen4706, 1024 replay states, threads2/CUDA-1, bez kontrolera
ani aktualizacji learnera: na starcie aktor wybiera akcję5 (pełny skręt z brake tap)
z prawdopodobieństwem około .969, krytyk akcję41 (prosto z brake tap).
1000 kroków niezależnej kopii głowy przy stałym Q podniosło zgodność aktor/Q
z .340 do .804/.807 dla beta0/.0005. Usunięcie kotwicy daje podobny wynik;
próba nie zapisuje polityki i nie dowodzi poprawności krytyka ani jakości jazdy.

Następna hipoteza: wrócić do lepszego target.8/beta.0005 i przetestować wyłącznie
szybsze dopasowanie aktora (actor LR9e-4 zamiast3e-4). Krytyk i temperatura
zachowają LR3e-4. Dodano opcjonalny parametr SD-SAC z domyślnym zachowaniem

Pierwsze przejęcie SD-SAC retry02 nie rozpoczęło learnera: confirm_ready odrzucił
player_not_ready. Odczyt okna wykazał końcowy ekran ostatniej walidacji QR.
Po potwierdzeniu ekranu i wybraniu widocznego Improve przywrócono local player
na starcie. Nie zmieniono mapy, nagrody ani frozen sources; stara kolejka,
failure i normalne guard closure zachowane. Read-only/checks i bounded probe

PPO historyczne3/10 nadal ogranicza pełny start. Monitor ACTIVE15min;

bez automatycznych miesięcznych startów; każdy nowy STOP nadrzędny.


## Autonomiczne wznowienie po pauzie — 5 października 22:12 Warsaw

Użytkownik odwołał pauzę: „Ogarnij wszystko sam, ja idę spać”, następnie
„Nawet jak będzie problem to sam to ogarnij”. Nowe ograniczone próby retry02
zachowują checkpoint zatrzymanego QR retry01 i wszystkie stare STOP jako dowody.
RESUME-AUTHORIZATION przypina ich hash i mtime; każdy nowy lub dotknięty STOP zatrzymuje.
Nie wznowiono starego runnera ani checkpointu na innym kodzie.

Po ponownym uruchomieniu gry przywrócono obraz i istniejącą wtyczkę telemetrii.
Pierwsze otwarcie kopii mapy w edytorze zgłaszało brak startu; bez zapisywania
zmian zamknięto ją i otwarto oryginalny zapis My Maps/tmrl-test.Map.Gbx.
Gra pokazuje VALIDATED i start, session protocol potwierdza oczekiwany UID
oqIJ5rQDRrNwLPTh9H2p_W4tLof oraz ready. Dokładnej przyczyny pierwszego otwarcia
nie udowodniono. Nie zmieniono geometrii, nagrody ani zamrożonych źródeł.

## Nowe ograniczone QR → SD-SAC uruchomione — 5 października 17:04 Warsaw

Użytkownik potwierdził: **„Tak, nowe ograniczone QR → SD-SAC”** po pytaniu
o nowy pilot QR do 3,5 godziny i osobny SD-SAC do 4 godzin. To nowa próba,
bez przedłużania lub restartowania kolejek zakończonych awarią.
Poprzednie awarie i wyniki PPO 3/10 oraz SD-SAC 0/10 pozostają zachowane.

Lokalny gracz i telemetria wróciły. Preflight wymaga gotowego gracza przed wejściem,
pomija bezwarunkowe potwierdzenie finish-screen, łączy telemetrię po resecie
i odrzuca brak powrotu na start (race_time > 2500 ms). Osobny test live potwierdził
reset do 210 ms; właściwy QR preflight do **240 ms**, właściwy UID i 33 pola.
Nie udowodniono, który element dawnego menu spowodował utratę gracza.
Zmiany dotyczą wyłącznie zewnętrznych helperów; zamrożone algorytmy są niezmienione.
Pięć testów kontraktu preflight, 31 testów nadzoru QR i 20 SD-SAC przeszło;
oba plany przeszły validate-only.

zamrożony kod `c4ec36a0`. Bramka pozostaje >=29/30 i mediana <=56,915 s,
pełny/drained/accounted checkpoint, finite/fingerprint/SHA, ważny timing max100 ms,
brak błędów i raport pominiętych ramek. Naprawa matematyczna nie gwarantuje jazdy.

Przypina nowy QR plan/rezerwację, wymaga obu ukończonych etapów, pełnego finite/drained
checkpointu, 30 ocen z matching SHA, normalnego zamknięcia guardu/procesów,
braku STOP i wolnego mutexu. Pasywne oczekiwanie kończy się **20:38:16 Warsaw**.

autoryzowanego celu SD-SAC albo jawnego STOP. Żadnych automatycznych miesięcznych
startów, zmian nagrody, fingerprint override ani wznawiania starych checkpointów.


## Aktualny wynik i blokada środowiska — 5 października 15:29 Warsaw

Ta aktualizacja zastępuje poniższe historyczne informacje o działającym PPO
i oczekujących procesach. PPO ukończył diagnostyczny uczony prefix cp70:
143360 kroków / 70 aktualizacji, finite i zgodny fingerprint; to nie jest pełny trening.
Dziesięć ocen dało **3/10 met**, medianę 55,34 s wyłącznie ukończonych prób.
Wszystkie pomiary timingu 6681/6681 są ważne, max 60 / p99 50 ms, bez błędów;
10778 pominiętych ramek, max 5. Timing treningu poprawił się do max 70 ms.
Skuteczność jazdy nadal nie przechodzi progu 8/10; krótszy czas trzech finisherów
nie dowodzi poprawy polityki względem wcześniejszego 8/10. Nie odblokowano pełnego startu.

QR przejął kolejkę o 15:07:14, lecz preflight zakończył się o 15:07:31:
po resecie nie otrzymano ramki telemetrii w 10 s. **Nie powstał learner, checkpoint
ani katalog treningu QR.** Jego procesy i guard zamknęły się normalnie, bez forcekill.
Oczekujący SD-SAC beta 0,005 prawidłowo przerwał przejęcie po awarii QR i również
nie rozpoczął treningu. Poprzedni SD-SAC pozostaje 0/10 i full BLOCKED.

Osobny ograniczony probe połączenia dopiero po resecie też zakończył się timeoutem.
Pięć testów kontraktu z atrapami przeszło; nie są dowodem usunięcia rzeczywistej awarii.
OpenPlanet potwierdza właściwy UID, ale `confirm_ready` zwraca `player_not_ready`.
Okno gry pokazuje przejazd bez HUD-u; dostępne próby wejścia do menu nie przywróciły
lokalnego gracza. Poproszono użytkownika o ponowne uruchomienie walidacji mapy.

Dowody są w `artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/qr-preflight-recovery-20261005/`
(`recovery-status.json`, `session-state.json`, `probe.log`, archiwum pierwotnej awarii).
Wskaźnik active-queue nadal opisuje zakończoną awarią QR, a nie żywy kontroler;
zawsze czytaj status kolejki. Wszystkie obserwowane procesy zamknięto.
Nie uruchamiaj ponownie użytych runnerów ani zakończonych etapów. Ewentualne wznowienie
wyłącznie pozostałego QR wymaga osobnego jawnego recovery, gotowej telemetrii,
braku nowego STOP i wolnego mutexu, z zachowaniem pierwotnego **SAVE 18:27:14 /
HARD 18:37:14 Warsaw**. Limit nie zaczyna się ponownie od recovery.
Nowa rezerwacja SD-SAC musi wskazywać rzeczywistego poprawnie zakończonego poprzednika.
Cel dalszej naprawy SD-SAC i monitor ACTIVE pozostają obowiązujące; żadnych automatycznych
miesięcznych startów, zmian wspólnej nagrody ani aktualizacji zamrożonych źródeł.


## Dalsza naprawa SD-SAC — 5 października 13:33 Warsaw

Użytkownik polecił: „No to poprawiaj SD SAC tak długo aż będzie sensowny”.
Nadzór pozostaje ACTIVE również po samym PPO/QR, jeśli SD-SAC nie spełni bramki.
Ostatni SD-SAC nadal ma **0/10 met** i niepełny budżet; pełne treningi są zablokowane.

Audyt CPU zgodnego checkpointu na 1024 stanach wykazał, że przy beta 0,5 kara
utrzymująca entropię zachowania znosi niemal cały gradient preferencji wartości
(cosinus −0,9295; udział zniesiony 1,0059). To lokalna diagnoza, nie dowód błędu
matematycznego całego algorytmu. Nowa hipoteza zmienia tylko beta **0,5 → 0,005**;
wspólna nagroda, model, target entropy 0,8 i budżet 145408 pozostają takie same.
Kod dodaje diagnostykę prawdopodobieństw akcji i zgodności z krytykami oraz
usuwa zbędny graf krytyków z kroku aktora, zachowując cel i gradient aktora.

Nowy pilot faktycznie oczekuje w `queue-sd-sac-anchor005-20261005`:
**launcher 48368 / waiter 57588**, created_time 1791199959.0079837, bez kontrolera
i `launch.json`. `sd-sac-pending-queue.json` wskazuje rezerwację; właściwy stan
odczytuje się z kolejki. Frozen runtime `tmrl-sd-sac-anchor-runtime` ma źródła
`4706a06b0eea5ba3fe0d2c6aa1ad641ed29aca84`, opublikowane atomowo na obu branchach.

Kolejność pozostaje **PPO → QR → nowy SD-SAC**. PPO działał o 13:33 online:
49152 kroki / 24 pełne aktualizacje rolloutu, finite, bez awarii.
Terminy PPO i QR oraz ich zamrożone źródła są bez zmian. SD-SAC przejmuje dopiero
po normalnym końcu QR, pełnym rozliczonym checkpointcie QR, 30 ocenach, zamknięciu
procesów i guardu, braku STOP i wolnym mutexie. Pasywne oczekiwanie ma limit
**20:09 Warsaw**; nie uruchamia learnera. Po faktycznym starcie SD-SAC:
trening maks. 10800 s, 10 greedy maks. 2100 s, całe zadanie maks. **4 h**,
SAVE 600 s przed HARD. Właściwe daty pojawią się w jego `launch.json`.

Przeszło **106 testów uczenia, 20 testów nadzoru, 42 schematy**, Ruff, mypy
zmienionego źródła i standardowy CPU update/zstd roundtrip rzeczywistej kompozycji
GNN / 78 akcji. To dowody poprawności technicznej, nie nowy wynik jazdy.
Bramka pozostaje: pełny budżet, drained/accounted credit, finite/fingerprint/SHA,
10 kompletnych ważnych prób, **co najmniej 8/10 met**, max 100 ms, brak błędów,
raport pominiętych ramek. Nieudany wynik zachowujemy i diagnozujemy kolejną
uzasadnioną hipotezę w osobnym ograniczonym świeżym pilocie; bez automatycznych
pełnych treningów i bez deklaracji globalnej optymalności lub kwalifikacji 3 seedów.

## Nowy wynik SD-SAC i przejęcie QR — 5 października 12:50 Warsaw

Świeży SD-SAC target0,8 / beta0,5 / behavior nie zaliczył bramki: **0/10 met**,
średnio **3,552% trasy**. Wszystkie 10 prób mają ważny timing, 1961/1961 pomiarów,
max/p99 50 ms, brak błędów kontrolera i telemetrii; 2440 pominiętych ramek,
maksimum 5. Nie ma potwierdzonej poprawy skuteczności jazdy. Pełny SD-SAC
pozostaje zablokowany, generator i konfiguracje pełnych treningów bez promocji.

Pilot zakończono przez limit czasu o 12:44:29 Warsaw: **135406/145408 kroków**,
30775 aktualizacji, credit576,5, earned=accounted31351,5. Checkpoint jest finite
z potwierdzonym fingerprintem/SHA, ale budżet jest niepełny i credit nie został
wyczerpany. To ograniczenie testu, nie pełny ukończony trening. SHA checkpointu:
`6fdab80112a7e27a5bfd65cd98e01eb20297f647b4b7258045ea726e82154175`.
Dowody: `queue-ppo-sd-sac-repair-20261005/sd-sac-completion.json`,

`tmrl-repair-diag-sd-sac-s17-benchmark-20261005T104448532426/evaluation.json`.

PPO rozpoczął świeży prefix o **12:47:13 Warsaw**, PID54168, W&B `yygy62p7` online.
Oceniamy zachowany pełny uczony cp70/143360 i 10 przejazdów zgodnie z protokołem.
SAVE16:19/HARD16:29 poprzedniej fazy pozostają bez zmian.

Przed rozpoczęciem QR wykryto dodatkowy błąd pomocnika przekazania kolejki:
czytał `sd-sac-evaluation.json` / `ppo-evaluation.json`, choć poprzednik zapisuje
`eval-sd-sac-evaluation.json` / `eval-ppo-evaluation.json`. Zatrzymano wyłącznie
pasywny pomocnik, przed jakimkolwiek etapem QR, zachowano snapshot w
`passive-wait-handoff-repair-02` i poprawiono nazwy odczytu. Nowa regresja
odtworzyła błąd; po poprawce **31 testów nadzoru** przeszło, w tym rzeczywisty
kontrakt nazw i odrzucanie niepełnego prefixu / brakujących prób / niefinite cp.
Ruff helperów i validate-only planu przeszły.

QR ponownie oczekuje: **launcher8384 / waiter55608**, bez kontrolera i bez
`launch.json` QR. `passive-handoff-recovery.json` i `pending-queue.json` wskazują
nową tożsamość. Źródła QR c4ec36a0 i SD-SAC/PPO266e2629 bez zmian; poprzednik nie
był restartowany. Warunki przejęcia, deadline oczekiwania16:34, własny limitQR
3h30 od rzeczywistego startu i bramki29/30 / mediana≤56,915s pozostają niezmienione.
Matematyczna poprawka QR nadal wymaga świeżego wyniku w grze. Monitor ACTIVE.

Poniższe sekcje zachowują wcześniejsze stany i dowody.

## Przywrócone oczekiwanie QR — 5 października 12:21 Warsaw

Pomocnik oczekujący QR zakończył się o 12:09 z `PermissionError` podczas odczytu
`status.json` poprzedniej kolejki. QR nie otworzył kontrolera, nie rozpoczął
treningu ani oceny. Zachowano pierwotny błąd, logi, rezerwację i helpery w
`queue-qr-repair-20261005/passive-wait-recovery-01`; zapis w
`passive-recovery.json` potwierdza zamknięcie starego pomocnika i brak etapów QR.

Poprawiono tylko odczyty zewnętrznego pomocnika QR i jego przyszłego guardu:
ponawianie trwa najwyżej 5 s, a trwały błąd nadal przerywa pracę. Wszystkie
26 testów CPU nadzoru przeszło, w tym 5 nowych regresji: rzeczywista wyłączna
blokada pliku Windows, ograniczony trwały błąd uprawnień, przerwa podmiany pliku,
odrzucenie uszkodzonego JSON i niedozwolonego długiego ponawiania. Walidacja
planu i Ruff helperów przeszły. Poprzednie 32 testy źródeł i próba QR64 update /
zstd roundtrip pozostają zachowanymi dowodami, nie nowym wynikiem jazdy.

Oczekiwanie przywrócono: launcher **60600**, runner **60380**,
`waiting_for_predecessor`, pusty `runner.err`, bez `launch.json` QR.
`pending-queue.json` wskazuje nową tożsamość; aktywna kolejka pozostaje SD-SAC/PPO
z runnerem 61144 i guardem 3356. Nie zmieniono jej źródeł, helperów ani etapów.
Zamrożone runtime QR c4ec36a0 oraz SD-SAC/PPO 266e2629 pozostały bez zmian.

Zakres i warunki przejęcia są niezmienione: wszystkie cztery etapy poprzednika,
pełny uczony prefix PPO i 10+10 ocen, zamknięte procesy, wolna wspólna blokada,
brak nowego STOP. Oczekiwanie kończy się najpóźniej o 16:34 Warsaw. QR nadal ma
własne 3 godz. 30 min od rzeczywistego startu, SAVE 10 min przed HARD i wcześniej
zapisane bramki 29/30 met / mediana ≤56,915 s. Wynik nowego QR w grze nadal
oczekiwany. Nadzór pozostaje ACTIVE; pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono.

Poniższe sekcje zachowują wcześniejsze stany i dowody.

## Aktualny stan — QR-DQN dołączony po PPO, 5 października 12:05 Warsaw

Użytkownik polecił poprawić QR-DQN i dodać go do kolejki, następnie zezwolił
na późniejsze zakończenie testów, także po19:00, przed prawdziwymi treningami.
Poprawka QR jest opublikowana: **c4ec36a0b6d2eaf948c9eb24a783e344b81c1314**.
Nowy QR używa osobnego frozenruntime `tmrl-qr-repair-runtime`; aktualne
SD-SAC/PPO266e2629 oraz starsze runtime pozostają bez zmian.

Faktycznie dodany etap oczekujący: `queue-qr-repair-20261005`, launcher28636,
runner61196, status `waiting_for_predecessor`, bez kontrolera i bez `launch.json`.
`pending-queue.json` wskazuje QR; `active-queue.json` do zakończenia PPO wskazuje
bieżącą kolejkę SD-SAC/PPO. QR przejmie wskaźnik dopiero po wszystkich czterech
etapach, potwierdzonych wynikach, zamknięciu ich procesów/guardu i sprawdzeniu
wspólnej blokady. Nie uruchamia drugiego kontrolera ani nie ponawia poprzednika.

QR: świeży145408/seed17, max8100s, potem30greedy/max2700s. Nowa faza ma osobny
limit3h30 od faktycznego startu QR i SAVE10min przed HARD. Konkretne godziny
będą dopiero w QR `launch.json`/`effective-deadline.json`;16:29 pozostaje limitem
poprzedniej fazy. Jej prawidłowe zamknięcie nie kończy jeszcze autoryzowanego QR.
Nowy STOP, awaria lub niepełne PPO zatrzymują automatyczne przejęcie.

32testy źródeł +21testów CPU nadzoru i bramki przeszły, Ruff i mypy zmienionego
źródła przeszły. Pełna konfiguracja kompozycji QR64 przeszła standardowy validator
na CPU: syntetyczny update i zstd checkpoint roundtrip, bez gry, kontrolera i
nowego W&B. Bramka QR jest z góry: pełny/drained/finite/fingerprint/SHA pilot,
30ważnychprób/max100ms/noerrors/skips, >=29/30met i mediana<=56,915s. Wynik
jazdy nadal oczekiwany; matematyczna poprawka nie gwarantuje poprawy polityki.

Monitor ACTIVEco15min obejmuje również oczekujący QR. Raport końcowy i PAUSED
nastąpią po wszystkich autoryzowanych etapach lub ich zatrzymaniu/awarii/limicie.
Pełnych treningów nie uruchamiamy; QR, PPO i SD-SAC nie otrzymują deklaracji
optymalnych HP lub gotowości trzech seedów bez rzeczywistych wyników.

Stary fixturepoczątkowegoplanu odłożono: historyczna retencja usunęła cp659; jego nowy start jest zabroniony. Pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany, wspólna nagroda bez zmian, bez automatycznych miesięcznych treningów. Live wynik nowych poprawek jest jeszcze w toku.


## Zakończenie nocy i naprawy po przedłużeniu — 5 października

Nocna kolejka ukończyła wszystkie etapy 09:26:36 Warsaw; ostatni QR **26/30 met**,
mediana56,915s/średnia57,124s, max50ms, poprawny timing i brak błędów.
Użytkownik następnie przedłużył pracę poleceniem „Możesz robić dłużej niż do 10
 tylko spraw by PPO i DSAC poprawnie działało”. Wcześniejsze terminy są historią
zakończonej kolejki; nowe ograniczone testy mają własny jawny limit.
Reset nowego kodu zaliczony w grze; poprawki rozgrzewki/timingów PPO i stabilizacji
SD-SAC są testowane przed świeżymi pilotami. Pełny SD-SAC pozostaje zablokowany,
PPO zachowuje entropy0,01. Nagroda pozostaje wspólna; automatycznych miesięcznych
treningów nie uruchamiamy. Pełne wyniki, dowody, ograniczenia i nowy protokół:

## SAC 30 prób — 5 października, 09:10 Europe/Warsaw

Zachowany stary cp33854 na runtime d0dfe645 ukończył ocenę: **30/30 met**,

## TQC 30 prób — 5 października, 08:40 Europe/Warsaw

Zachowany stary cp33858 na runtime d0dfe645 ukończył ocenę:
**29/30 met**, średnia **44,384 s**, mediana **44,300 s**, najlepsza **43,790 s**.
Wszystkie 30 prób mają ważny timing: 26 222/26 222 pomiarów, max **60 ms**,

## Powtarzalność IQN — 5 października, 08:11 Europe/Warsaw

Ocena zachowanego starego cp33854, na zamrożonym runtime d0dfe645, ukończona:
**29/30 met**, średnia ukończonych **49,452 s**, mediana **49,400 s**,
najlepsza **48,370 s**. Wszystkie 30 prób mają ważny timing:
29 587/29 587 pomiarów, max/p99 **50 ms**, brak błędów telemetrii/kontrolera.
Pominięte ramki **15 564**, maksimum 5. Wynik wspiera powtarzalność tej polityki
na seed17; nie dowodzi powtarzalności uczenia na trzech seedach ani celu 37 s.
Nie zmieniamy IQN arbitralnie po dawnym wyniku 1/2: baseline pozostaje.
Pełne nowe starty nadal wymagają wspólnego nowego commita, kalibracji lokalnej,
smoke i 30 końcowych prób dla każdego z seedów 17/29/43.
Dowód: `tmrl-overnight-diag-iqn-s17-benchmark-20261005T054442205511/evaluation.json`;
SHA checkpointu `ad4fabf38558c893ed54546143a47418eb3bc589925d828a95968f5a932d4f95`.
Istniejący runner rozpoczął TQC 08:10:48 Warsaw; SAC i QR pozostają w kolejce.
Kampania nadal trwa, SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 bez zmian.

## Decyzja PPO — 5 października, 07:55 Europe/Warsaw

Porównanie obu wariantów zakończone na wspólnym cp70: **143 360 uczonych kroków /
70 aktualizacji**, pełne prefixy diagnostyczne, skończone checkpointy,
zgodność fingerprint i SHA potwierdzona. Pełnych miesięcznych treningów nie wykonano.

| Współczynnik entropii | Mety | Mediana ukończonych | Średnia ukończonych | Max/p99 kroku | Pominięte ramki |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0,01 baseline | 8/10 | 56,445 s | 56,585 s | 50/50 ms | 18 648 (max 6) |
| 0 | 7/10 | 57,880 s | 57,673 s | 50/50 ms | 18 173 (max 6) |

Wszystkie 20 prób mają ważny timing i brak błędów kontrolera/telemetrii.
Wariant 0 nie osiągnął minimum 8/10 met, miał niższy odsetek met oraz medianę
około 2,54% wolniejszą, zamiast wymaganych przynajmniej 5% poprawy.
**Zachowujemy baseline 0,01 w generatorze i pełnych konfiguracjach 17/29/43.**
Nie jest to dowód globalnej optymalności ani ukończenie końcowych 30 prób na seed.
Skoki race-clock treningu ponad 100 ms nadal stanowią ograniczenie lokalne.
Dowód decyzji: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/ppo-comparison-decision.json`.
Ocena wariantu 0: `tmrl-overnight-diag-ppo-entropy0-s17-benchmark-20261005T053439289662/evaluation.json`,

Kampania trwa: istniejący runner rozpoczął 30 prób IQN 07:44:38 Warsaw.
SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 bez zmian; pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany.

## PPO baseline — 5 października, 05:25 Europe/Warsaw

Świeży PPO entropy coefficient 0,01 zakończył krótki prefix diagnostyczny.
Do porównania wybrano potwierdzony, skończony cp70: **143 360 uczonych kroków,
70 aktualizacji**, processed_transitions=transitions; prefix_complete=true,
full_training_complete=false, wspólny harmonogram LR 2 048 000.
SHA256: `250767107f53a5917d9cc54fb8426539c8d234fd83a8dd01d09faf9bc8660bbb`.
Dziesięć prób greedy: **8/10 met**, średnia ukończonych 56,585 s,
mediana **56,445 s**, najlepsza 55,520 s. Dwie porażki przy około 81,20% postępu.
Wszystkie próby mają ważny timing; 11 068/11 068 pomiarów, max/p99 **50 ms**,
brak błędów kontrolera i telemetrii. Pominięte ramki: **18 648**, maksimum 6.
W treningu występowały skoki race-clock powyżej 100 ms (maksimum 530 ms);
poprawna ocena nie usuwa tego ograniczenia lokalnego treningu.
To wynik jednego seeda i 10 prób diagnostycznych, nie końcowe 30 prób na seed
ani dowód globalnej optymalności. Baseline 0,01 pozostaje ustawieniem domyślnym;
wybór 0 wymaga pełnego porównania zgodnego z ustalonym wcześniej protokołem.
Wariant entropy0 już działa od 05:21:32 Warsaw, W&B `yei92q7a`;
baseline `hymfpseo` potwierdzony finished. Kampania nadal trwa.
Dowody: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/ppo-baseline-completion.json` i
`tmrl-overnight-diag-ppo-baseline-s17-benchmark-20261005T031138975953/evaluation.json`.
SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 pozostają nadrzędne; pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono.

## Wynik SD-SAC — 5 października, 03:10 Europe/Warsaw

Pilot celu entropii 2,0 / beta 0 zakończył **145 487 kroków / 33 871 aktualizacji**.
Końcowy cp33871 ma skończone tensory, zgodny fingerprint i rozliczony kredyt
**0,75** (`earned = accounted = 33 871,75`). Ocena zakończona: **0/10 met**,
postęp 4,24–5,17%, średnio 4,42%. Wszystkie pomiary czasu ważne, max/p99 50 ms,
brak błędów telemetrii/kontrolera; 651 pominiętych ramek, maksimum 5.
Warunek minimum 8/10 met NIE został spełniony: **pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany**,
hipoteza diagnostyczna nie zostaje promowana do konfiguracji seedów 17/29/43.
Poprawny zapis i sprawny pomiar nie oznaczają skutecznej polityki greedy.
Dowody: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/dsac-completion.json` oraz
`tmrl-overnight-diag-dsac-e200-b0-s17-benchmark-20261005T005546181914/evaluation.json`
w `artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison`. W&B trening `2fslk8zh`, ocena `vepn4pyj`.

To wynik częściowy kampanii. Świeży PPO baseline ruszył 02:58:36 Warsaw;
pozostałe etapy prowadzi istniejący runner. Nagroda i zamrożone runtime bez zmian.
Termin zapisu 10:24, twardy koniec 10:34 pozostają nadrzędne.


## Aktualizacja — 5 października, wznowienie 10 godzin

Aktualna kampania `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005` działa od **00:50:18**;
zapis do **10:24**, twarde zatrzymanie **10:34 Europe/Warsaw**.
SD-SAC wznowiony z 12 658 kroków i pełnego zapisu. Następnie dwa świeże prefixy
PPO (baseline entropii 0,01 / hipoteza 0,0) i pomiary powtarzalności pozostałych
algorytmów. Plan i warunki wyboru są w [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Wcześniejsza kolejka została zatrzymana i nie jest uruchamiana ponownie.
TQC/SAC/QR zachowują pozytywne baseline; IQN wymaga sprawdzenia stabilności,
SD-SAC pozostaje zablokowany, nowe PPO wymaga wyników. Pełnych treningów nie
uruchomiono. Końcowy raport oraz wspólny commit trzech seedów powstaną po testach.

## Historia: kolejka z 4 października 17:28, zatrzymana na polecenie użytkownika

Kod zespołu opublikowany na obu branchach: **8f440075**. Nowy pilot korzysta
z osobnego, czystego i zamrożonego `tmrl-tuning-runtime` na tym commicie.
Stare IQN/PPO będą oceniane na zachowanym `tmrl-algorithm-runs` (`d0dfe645`,
źródła Python `378f9c6a`), bez przenoszenia checkpointów między wersjami.

Kolejka `queue-tuning-20261004` wystartowała **17:27:56 Europe/Warsaw**.
Termin zapisu **20:17:56**, twardy koniec **20:27:56**. To zatwierdzone nowe
3 godziny łącznie, nie przedłużanie poprzedniej kampanii. Wskaźnik
`artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/active-queue.json` wskazuje tę kolejkę.
SD-SAC `tmrl-tuning-dsac-entropy200-beta000-s17` działa, W&B
[o3aknhmz](https://wandb.ai/dsc-pjatk-warsaw/my-trackmania-agent/runs/o3aknhmz)
potwierdzony online/running. O 17:30 zapisano 1943 kroki w fazie warmup,
ważny timing ostatniego epizodu (p99 50 ms, max 60 ms), brak błędu telemetrii.
To kontrola uruchomienia, nie wynik uczenia ani kwalifikacja SD-SAC.

Następnie planowane są 10 ocen SD-SAC, 10 IQN i 5 PPO w pozostałym czasie.
Warunki promocji SD-SAC oraz sprawdzone ustawienia opisuje [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Monitor działa co 5 minut i ma zakończyć pracę po raporcie tej kampanii.
Pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono. Końcowy dobór SD-SAC pozostaje otwarty do
wyniku jazdy; jego pełne uruchomienia są nadal zablokowane.


## Nowe przygotowanie i testy — 2026-10-04 po 17:00

Po zakończeniu poprzedniej kampanii użytkownik zatwierdził naprawy oraz
**do 3 godzin łącznie nowych testów w grze**. Aktualne decyzje o parametrach,
kolejność prób, poprawki PPO i warunki wyboru SD-SAC opisuje [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Pełne treningi pozostają ręczne; SD-SAC nadal jest zablokowany do wyniku nowego
pilota. Stare checkpointy zachowują swój zamrożony runtime. Poniższy raport
15:41 i starsze sekcje dokumentują zakończoną poprzednią kampanię, nie nową kolejkę.

## Raport końcowy kampanii — 2026-10-04, 15:41 Europe/Warsaw

**Wszystkie zaplanowane piloty i ich krótkie ewaluacje zakończone.** Nie
uruchomiono pełnych treningów. Aktualna kolejka `queue-status-recovery-20261004`
ma stan `queue_completed`; nie powtarzać etapów ani uruchamiać starych runnerów.
Poniższa tabela i warunki startu zastępują historyczne decyzje dalej w pliku.

| Algorytm / osoba | Trening pilota | Krótka ewaluacja bez eksploracji | Decyzja |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TQC / Kamil | 145 433 kroków; 71/181 met; ostatnie 20/20 | 2/2: 45,24 i 44,06 s; średnia 44,65 s | Pozytywny pilot; baseline bez zmian |
| PPO / Kuba P. | 145 408 kroków; 71 rolloutów, 4280 kroków Adam; 13 met w pełnych śladach | 2/2: 58,27 i 59,13 s; średnia 58,70 s | Działa, wolniejsza jazda; lokalny test timingu |
| IQN / Jakub | 145 418 kroków; 55/200 met; ostatnie 17/20 | 1/2: 49,90 s; nieukończony przejazd 81,27% | Kandydat do dalszych prób; stabilność niepotwierdzona |
| QR / Jakub | 145 425 kroków; 53/174 met; ostatnie 19/20 | 2/2: 57,07 i 56,81 s; średnia 56,94 s | Pozytywny pilot; baseline bez zmian |
| Discrete SAC / Borys | beta 0: 145 412 kroków; 0/246 met, maks. 62,9% | 0/3: postęp 78,92%, 5,44%, 5,40% | **Pełny start zablokowany** |
| Continuous SAC / bez przydziału | 145 416 kroków; 83/198 met; ostatnie 20/20 | 2/2: 43,78 i 44,75 s; średnia 44,265 s | Pozytywny pilot; ręczny pełny start odblokowany |

Continuous SAC ukończył trening o 15:39:08, ewaluację o 15:41:03. Checkpoint
`distributed-update-00033854.pt`: 33 854 aktualizacje, rzeczywisty kredyt 0,0;
wszystkie 2128 sprawdzonych tensorów zmiennoprzecinkowych skończone. Najlepszy
czas treningowy 44,06 s. Wszystkie logowane straty i alpha skończone,
ostatnia logowana alpha 0,02080. W&B treningu `dx93ox8g` i ewaluacji `zpf9xcap`
ma stan `finished`. Oba przejazdy ewaluacyjne mają ważne pomiary odstępów,
max/p99 50 ms i brak błędów telemetrii/kontrolera. Pominięte ramki 94 i 97,
maksimum 3 i 1. W treningu zdarzały się odstępy do 210 ms; ocena lokalnego
timingu nadal jest potrzebna na każdym komputerze.

SAC zachowuje sprawdzone model, nagrodę i hiperparametry. Po tym wyniku
usunięto wyłącznie jego blokadę pełnego startu w `run_assigned.ps1`;
ochrona zajętej gry, istniejącego runu i blokada SD-SAC pozostają aktywne.
To dopuszczenie do dalszego eksperymentu po lokalnym smoke, nie zaliczenie
końcowych progów 30 prób. Dwie próby na jednym seedzie nie dowodzą przewagi
SAC nad TQC ani pozostałymi algorytmami. Nie zmieniono wspólnej nagrody.

Po zmianie launchera przeszły oba testy: SD-SAC nadal blokowany, dopuszczony
SAC zatrzymuje się przy zajętej grze, istniejący run nie otwiera kontrolera.
Ruff i kontrola różnic przeszły. Ponownie sprawdzono 36 schematów i zasoby
map oraz pełne SAC 17/29/43: 2 048 000 kroków, 30 prób, model i learner jak
w pilocie. Wcześniejsze 40 testów oraz 9 syntetycznych CPU update/checkpoint
pozostają walidacją niezmienionego kodu uczenia; nie są testem długiej jazdy.

### Sprawdzenie poprawionego resetu w grze

Po zakończeniu kolejki, przy braku procesów treningu/ewaluacji i STOP,
wykonano bezpośrednie `environment.reset` z nowego checkoutu `tmrl-training-fixes`
na kodzie `03a0f4a2`, bez launcherowego preflightu i bez learnera.
UID `oqIJ5rQDRrNwLPTh9H2p_W4tLof` zgodny; sukces po 12,922 s,
zegar wyścigu 10 ms, 33 pola, `telemetry_health=ok`. Kontroler i klient
telemetrii zamknięte w `finally`. Jest to lokalny test startu/resetu, nie
długi test jazdy ani kwalifikacja sprzętu kolegów. Dowód:
`artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/queue-status-recovery-20261004/source-live-reset.json`.

### Warunki ręcznych pełnych startów

- Jeden wspólny nowy commit zespołu z obu branchy, osobne checkouty i start
  od zera. Zapisać hash. Nie wznawiać starych checkpointów na nowym kodzie
  ani omijać fingerprintów; zachowany checkout pilotów pozostaje zamrożony.
- Seedy 17/29/43, po 2 048 000 kroków; końcowo 30 greedy trials na seed.
  Konfiguracje pełne i schematy są sprawdzone; nie przenosić wag/replayu pilota.
- Każdy komputer: własna kalibracja sterowania, lokalny smoke nowego kodu,
  sprawdzenie CUDA, UID, W&B, odstępów decyzji i pominiętych ramek.
  Dla PPO szczególnie sprawdzić timing: jeden przejazd miał max 140 ms.
- SD-SAC: najpierw osobny pilot hipotezy celu entropii 2,0 / beta 0 i ewaluacja;
  ta hipoteza jest nadal **nieuruchomiona**, nie jest wybranym pełnym ustawieniem.
  Nie przypisywać niepowodzenia wspólnej nagrodzie ani pewnemu błędowi krytyka.

Dowody końca SAC: `queue-status-recovery-20261004/sac-result.json` i
`tmrl-test-v2-sac-s17-benchmark-20261004T133913799286/evaluation.json` w
`artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison`. Naprawiona awaria statusu Windows zachowała
logi/checkpointy; nowy runner zakończył pozostałe etapy bez błędów. Wszystkie
sprawdzone końcowe checkpointy mają skończone tensory. Instrukcje startu:
[HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md); audyt SD-SAC/PPO: [ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md](ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md).

## Historia kampanii — poniższe stany nie są aktualną kolejką

## Wynik QR i start SAC — 2026-10-04, około 13:30

**QR: pozytywny pilot techniczny; pozostawić hiperparametry baseline.**
145 425 kroków, 33 856 aktualizacji, kredyt 0,25; checkpoint
`distributed-update-00033856.pt`, wszystkie 1140 sprawdzonych tensorów
zmiennoprzecinkowych skończone. Trening 53/174 met, ostatnie 19/20,
najlepszy czas 60,74 s. Ewaluacja bez eksploracji **2/2: 57,07 s i 56,81 s**,
średnia 56,94 s. Oba pomiary odstępów ważne, maksimum i p99 50 ms,
błędy telemetrii/kontrolera null. Pominięte ramki 170 i 115, maksimum 3 i 2.
W&B `3gboyqdh` i `lc12mynj` mają stan `finished`.

To kandydat do pełnych prób Jakuba po lokalnym teście nowego wspólnego kodu.
Dwa przejazdy nie zastępują 30 prób na seed i nie dowodzą przewagi QR nad
IQN. IQN miał 1/2 met, ukończony przejazd 49,90 s; szybkość i ukończenia
trzeba raportować razem, bez rankingu algorytmów na jednym seedzie.

Continuous SAC wystartował 13:30:47 Europe/Warsaw, W&B `dx93ox8g` online;
po jego pilocie kolejka wykonuje dwa przejazdy ewaluacyjne. SAC pozostaje
zablokowany w pełnym launcherze do oceny wyniku. SD-SAC nadal zablokowany.
Dowody QR: `queue-status-recovery-20261004/qr-result.json` i wskazany tam
`evaluation.json`. To częściowy raport: kampania oraz monitor nadal trwają
z granicą zapisu 16:05 i zakończeniem 16:15. Test poprawionego resetu nowego
kodu w grze czeka na zakończenie SAC i brak procesów sterujących grą.

## Aktualizacja — 2026-10-04, około 11:25

IQN ukończył 145 418 kroków i 33 854 aktualizacje, zachowując kredyt 0,5.
Końcowy `distributed-update-00033854.pt` ma skończone tensory. Trening:
55/200 met, ostatnie 17/20, najlepszy czas 52,79 s. Krótka ewaluacja bez
eksploracji: **1/2 met**, ukończony przejazd 49,90 s; nieukończony 81,27%.
Oba przejazdy bez błędów kontrolera/telemetrii, maksymalny odstęp zegara 50 ms.
Pominięte ramki nadal występują: 368 i 401, maksimum 2 i 4. Jeden ukończony
przejazd nie potwierdza stabilności i nie zastępuje 30 prób na seed ani nie
pozwala ogłaszać przewagi algorytmu. W&B treningu `queim8uy` i ewaluacji
`m12bec84` potwierdzają `finished`.

QR wystartował o 11:20 Europe/Warsaw, W&B `3gboyqdh` online; po nim SAC.
Windows zablokował podmianę `status.json` starego runnera. Trening IQN
zakończył się niezależnie i zapisano checkpoint; nie powtarzamy go. Nowa
jawna kolejka `queue-status-recovery-20261004` zawiera tylko ewaluację IQN
(już ukończona), QR/eval oraz SAC/eval. Runner ponawia atomowy zapis przy
blokadzie pliku, a przy awarii zatrzymuje i zapisuje dziecko przed wyjściem.
Cztery testy obejmują rzeczywistą blokadę Windows, błąd zapisu, STOP i zajętą
grę. Poprawka jest w zewnętrznym helperze; źródła pilota pozostają zamrożone.
Dowody: `iqn-completion.json`, `iqn-evaluation.json`, `test_runner.py` w kolejce.
Granica zapisu 16:05, koniec kampanii 16:15; pełnych treningów nie uruchamiamy.
To nadal częściowy raport. SD-SAC pozostaje zablokowany; lokalny test nowego
resetu czeka na zakończenie wszystkich procesów sterujących grą.

## Poprawki przed pełnymi startami — 2026-10-04

Przygotowano poprawki w osobnym checkoutcie `tmrl-training-fixes`:

- Timeout pierwszego odczytu telemetrii środowiska przechodzi przez istniejące
  odzyskiwanie: zamknięcie połączenia i restart mapy, zamiast kończyć trening.
  Zachowano kontrolę spadku zegara po restarcie. Launcher dodatkowo uruchamia
  walidację przed pierwszym odczytem, aby uniknąć oczekiwania na timeout.
- PPO loguje `train/rollout` oraz `rollout/finished_episodes` w W&B: wszystkie
  mety z segmentu, rzeczywiste końce epizodów i sztuczne granice osobno.
  Oś W&B korzysta z łącznej liczby kroków, a nie długości pojedynczego segmentu.
  Historyczne piloty zachowują swoje stare logi; ich mety rekonstruuje audyt.
- Launcher blokuje niegotowe pełne SD-SAC/SAC, drugiego kontrolera i istniejący
  katalog runu. `-Pilot` dla SD-SAC wybiera istniejącą hipotezę 2,0 nats / beta 0,
  a dla pozostałych pojedynczy seed pilota. Pełne runy nie startują automatycznie.

Nagroda i hiperparametry baseline PPO/TQC/IQN/QR/SAC pozostają bez zmian.
SD-SAC nadal nie ma wybranego pełnego ustawienia. Wartość 2,0 wymaga jazdy
i ewaluacji; nie jest przenoszona do konfiguracji trzech pełnych seedów.

Weryfikacja bez sterowania grą: 30 testów resetu, treningu i W&B; 8 testów
workflowów actor-critic; testy launchera i ochrony istniejącego runu; ruff i mypy.
Test launchera sprawdza blokadę obu niegotowych algorytmów oraz zajętej gry.
36 konfiguracji i pliki map przeszły kontrolę schematu; wszystkie 9 algorytmów
z manifestu przeszło syntetyczną aktualizację CPU i zapis/odczyt checkpointu.
Po zakończeniu kolejki nadal obowiązuje lokalny test jazdy nowego kodu przed
pełnym startem, szczególnie pomiar timingu PPO. Nie wykonujemy go równolegle.

Nocne piloty i ich ewaluacje nadal używają zamrożonych źródeł `378f9c6a`.
Ich checkout nie został zaktualizowany. Pełne treningi od zera mają używać
nowego wspólnego commita z brancha zespołu, w osobnym katalogu; wszyscy muszą
zapisać jego hash. Starych checkpointów nie wznawiać na nowym kodzie, ponieważ
poprawki zmieniają fingerprint. Zachowany checkout pilotów służy do ich
dalszej ewaluacji i ewentualnego wznowienia bez obchodzenia tej kontroli.

To częściowa gotowość: TQC i PPO mają pozytywne piloty, SD-SAC jest zablokowany,
IQN ma wynik częściowy 1/2, QR pozytywny pilot 2/2; SAC jeszcze trenuje. Termin kampanii 16:15.

## Aktualizacja — 2026-10-04, około 09:20

PPO ukończył 145 408 kroków i 71 rolloutów / 4280 kroków Adam. Ewaluacja
2/2 met: 58,27 s i 59,13 s; checkpoint oraz W&B sprawdzone. W pełnych
śladach treningowych było 13 met, których skrócone logi nie pokazywały.
To działający pilot, ale wolniejsza polityka gazu/hamulca i pojedynczy odstęp
140 ms wymagają uwagi oraz lokalnego testu przed pełnym startem Kuby P.
Hiperparametry baseline i wspólna nagroda pozostają bez zmian.

SD-SAC pozostaje niegotowy: obecny cel entropii utrzymuje rozproszoną politykę;
próbka końcowego checkpointu daje tylko 29,2% średniej masy na pełny gaz bez
hamowania. Niższy cel 2,0 nadal jest nieuruchomionym testem, nie pełną decyzją.
Szczegóły, dowody i ograniczenia: [ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md](ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md).

Na prośbę użytkownika po IQN/QR dodano continuous SAC; termin całej kampanii
wydłużony do 16:15 Europe/Warsaw (zapis od 16:05). Pozostałe wyniki v2 czekają
na ukończenie. Pełne treningi nadal nie uruchamiają się automatycznie.

## Wynik TQC i wznowienie kolejki — 2026-10-04, około 06:45

**Kamil / TQC: pilot v2 przeszedł; pozostawić hiperparametry.** Trening zakończył
145 433 kroki i 33 858 aktualizacji. W checkpointcie końcowym zachowano kredyt
0,25 (ułamek następnej aktualizacji, nie zaległa pełna aktualizacja); wszystkie
sprawdzone tensory są skończone. W treningu 71/181 ukończeń, ostatnie 20/20,
najlepszy czas 43,84 s. Trening i ewaluacja mają stan `finished` w W&B.

Dwa przejazdy bez eksploracji: **45,24 s i 44,06 s**, średnia 44,65 s,
2/2 ukończeń. Brak błędów telemetryki lub kontrolera, maksymalny odstęp
zegara wyścigu 50 ms. Liczniki pominiętych ramek: 98 i 107, maksimum 3.
To pozytywny pilot techniczny i podstawa do pełnych prób po lokalnym teście
oraz kalibracji Kamila; dwa przejazdy nie zastępują końcowych 30 prób na seed.
Nie wnioskujemy o przewadze nad IQN/QR: inny rodzaj akcji i tylko jeden seed.
Konfiguracje pełne TQC dla seedów 17/29/43 pozostają zgodne z pilotem.

[Trening TQC](https://wandb.ai/dsc-pjatk-warsaw/my-trackmania-agent/runs/zhp8bg94),
[ewaluacja TQC](https://wandb.ai/dsc-pjatk-warsaw/my-trackmania-agent/runs/y4ug6zb6).

PPO po ewaluacji TQC zatrzymał się przy pierwszym resecie: ekran końca
walidacji nie wysyłał ramek, a reset próbował je odczytać przed restartem.
Nie wykonano aktualizacji ani nie zapisano checkpointu; nie jest to wynik
pilota PPO. Log i nieudaną próbę `4g67pfqd` zachowano. Przywrócono gotową mapę
i rozpoczęto jawną nową próbę `tmrl-test-v2-ppo-retry-s17` (W&B `6mmbtw48`).
Pierwszy rollout 2048 kroków i aktualizacja mają skończone straty oraz KL.

Nowy zewnętrzny runner wykonuje przed każdym procesem kontrolę UID,
restart walidacji i potwierdzenie gotowości **przed pierwszym odczytem ramek**.
Kontroler tego sprawdzenia jest zamykany przed uruchomieniem treningu.
Taką samą ochronę ma launcher `run_assigned.ps1` między pełnymi seedami.
To obejście w launcherze; źródła biblioteki i encodera pozostają zamrożone
na `378f9c6a`. Bezpośrednie `trackmaniarl train` z ekranu wyniku nadal wymaga
wcześniejszego powrotu do aktywnej walidacji. Poprawkę samego resetu należy
kwalifikować osobno; nie zmieniać kodu w działającym checkoutcie.

Pozostała kolejka: PPO → ewaluacja → IQN → ewaluacja → QR → ewaluacja.
Każdy pilot ma limit 2 h 15 min i budżet 145 408; zapis graniczny o 13:50.
SD-SAC pozostaje niegotowy. To nadal częściowy raport całej kampanii.

## Wynik SD-SAC v2 — 2026-10-04, około 04:35

To częściowa aktualizacja gotowości. W momencie tej oceny TQC, PPO,
IQN i QR oczekiwały na zakończenie; nowszy stan jest opisany powyżej.

**Borys / discrete SAC: nie uruchamiać jeszcze pełnych treningów.**
Wariant `tmrl-test-v2-dsac080-beta000-s17` zakończył 145 412 kroków i wszystkie
33 853 należne aktualizacje, z zerowym zaległym kredytem. Checkpoint końcowy
`distributed-update-00033853.pt` zawiera skończone parametry. Trening i ewaluacja
zakończyły się poprawnie i zostały zsynchronizowane z W&B.

W treningu: 0/246 ukończeń, maksymalny postęp 62,9%. W trzech przejazdach
deterministycznych: 0/3 ukończeń, postęp 78,9%, 5,4% i 5,4%. Brak błędów
telemetryki lub kontrolera, odstępy decyzji do 50 ms. Liczniki pominiętych
ramek telemetryki były niezerowe; nie oznacza to braku takich pominięć.
Wynik jest niestabilny i nie kwalifikuje konfiguracji do długich prób.

Wyłączenie kary entropii usuwa wykryte hamowanie wyostrzania polityki:
przy zbliżonych 77,6 tys. kroków entropia wyniosła około 3,55 zamiast 4,14.
Nie dowodzi to poprawy wyniku przy wspólnym budżecie. Przy limicie 100 009
kroków obie próby miały zero ukończeń, a maksymalny treningowy postęp wyniósł
46,3% dla kontroli i 41,1% bez kary. Końcowe ewaluacje używały różnych budżetów
treningowych i małej liczby przejazdów; nie ogłaszać przewagi algorytmu lub wariantu.

Następna hipoteza do sprawdzenia: pozostawić karę wyłączoną i obniżyć cel
entropii do **2,0 nats**, zachowując 78 akcji, nagrodę, model, seed, lr i UTD.
Przygotowano `configs/diagnostic/sd-sac-entropy200-beta000-s17.yaml`.
To osobny pilot od zera na 145 408 kroków, z limitem 2–3 godzin i późniejszą
ewaluacją bez losowania akcji. W tej kolejce nie uruchamia się go automatycznie:
pozostały czas należy do TQC/PPO/IQN/QR. Wartość 2,0 nie jest sprawdzonym
ustawieniem końcowym i nie zastępuje konfiguracji trzech pełnych seedów.

## Pierwotna ocena — 2026-10-03

**Aktualizacja:** poniżej zachowano pierwotną ocenę. Poprawki i nocny plan v2 są
w [NIGHT_QUEUE.md](NIGHT_QUEUE.md); stan wdrożenia opisany tam jest nowszy.

Planowany start: 2026-10-04, po spełnieniu warunków poniżej.
To ocena gotowości, nie zatwierdzenie wszystkich algorytmów.

| Osoba | Algorytm | Decyzja |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jakub | IQN + QR | Zachować hiperparametry; sprawdzić wspólne sterowanie |
| Borys | discrete SAC | Najpierw diagnostyka entropii i wydajności |
| Kamil | TQC | Poczekać na wynik pilota |
| Kuba P. | PPO | Poczekać na wynik pilota |

## Co wynika z pilotów

IQN ukończył 102 409 kroków; QR miał budżet 145 408. Nie traktować
różnicy wyników jako dowodu przewagi QR przy równym budżecie.
Pełne próby: 2 048 000 kroków, seedy 17, 29, 43; 30 przejazdów ewaluacyjnych
na końcowy checkpoint. Oddzielać wyniki treningowe (z eksploracją) od ewaluacji.

Discrete SAC: ukończona druga próba `tmrl-test-pilot-sd-sac-s17-1`,
145 412 kroków, 27 852 aktualizacje, 0/113 ukończonych epizodów,
maksymalny postęp około 40,6%. Pierwszej, przerwanej próby nie doklejać
do tej statystyki. Wznowienie drugiej próby kontynuowało jej stan.

W końcowych logach alpha wynosi około 0,777 (początkowo 0,2).
Kod ustawia domyślny cel entropii na 0,98 * ln(78) = 4,2696 przy maksimum
ln(78) = 4,3567. To silna presja na rozproszony wybór akcji.
Jest to hipoteza wyjaśniająca słabą jazdę, nie potwierdzona diagnoza.
Nie ma bezpośredniego logu entropii polityki; statystyka częstości wykonanych
akcji w odcinku trasy nie jest tym samym pomiarem.

## Hiperparametry

- IQN / QR: pozostawić lr=1e-4, gamma=0,995, batch=256, n_step=1,
  target_update_interval=1000 i epsilon 0,3 -> 0,01 przez 500 000 kroków.
  Oba uczą się kończyć mapę; nie ma jeszcze podstaw do zmiany tych parametrów.
- Discrete SAC: porównać obecny wariant z
  `configs/diagnostic/sd-sac-entropy080-s17.yaml`.
  Jedyna zmiana algorytmiczna: target_entropy=3,4853670613516736
  (=0,8 * ln(78)). Pozostawić lr=3e-4, automatyczną alpha,
  Q-clip i karę entropijną. Kandydat NIE zastępuje konfiguracji pełnych.
  Wartość 0,8 to propozycja do sprawdzenia, nie wynik strojenia ani zalecenie
  autorów publikacji. Porównać przy tym samym sterowaniu, seedzie i budżecie,
  obejrzeć alpha, critic loss, postęp i osobną ewaluację bez eksploracji.
  Sam brak finiszu w krótkim pilocie nie dowodzi błędu implementacji.
- TQC: na razie pozostawić lr=3e-4, tau=0,005 i obecne obcinanie kwantyli.
  Ocenić po pilocie; nie kopiować discrete target_entropy do ciągłej polityki.
- PPO: na razie pozostawić rollout=2048, minibatch=256, epochs=10,
  lr=3e-4, clip=0,2 i target_kl=0,02. Przed dopuszczeniem sprawdzić
  skończone straty, KL, zmianę polityki, stabilność wartości i checkpoint.
  Zmiana normalizacji nagród wymaga osobnego pilota, nie włączamy jej w ciemno.
- Wspólne: nie zmieniać jednocześnie nagrody, gamma, geometrii, akcji
  i architektury. Pilot diagnostyczny oraz koszty strojenia raportować osobno.

Znaczenie celu entropii badano w
[Target Entropy Annealing for Discrete Soft Actor-Critic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02852).
To uzasadnia sprawdzenie tego parametru, nie dowodzi skuteczności wartości 0,8
w Trackmanii.

Kandydat jest poza automatyczną kolejką i manifestem pełnych prób. Po zwolnieniu
gry oraz sprawdzeniu sterowania uruchom go osobno:

```powershell
uv run python -m trackmaniarl train experiments/tmrl_test_comparison/configs/diagnostic/sd-sac-entropy080-s17.yaml --stop-file artifacts/STOP-sd-sac-diagnostic
```

Nie uruchomiono go podczas tego przeglądu; sprawdzono poprawność schematu YAML.

## Rzeczywisty budżet aktualizacji — warunek przed startem

Przy warmup=10 000 i UTD=0,25 dla 145 412 kroków przypada 33 853 aktualizacje.
Discrete SAC wykonał 27 852: o 17,7% mniej. Kod `_credit_updates` ucina
kolejkę kredytu przy `distributed.max_update_credit=512`; opóźniony learner
może bezpowrotnie stracić aktualizacje. Identyczny YAML nie zapewnia więc
identycznego budżetu uczenia na różnych komputerach.

Na każdym komputerze po warmup mierzyć przynajmniej 15–30 minut stabilnej pracy:
updates_per_s, target_updates_per_s, update_credit, odstępy decyzji
i policy_lag_updates. Kredyt nie powinien stale rosnąć ani dochodzić do limitu.
Najpierw sprawdzić obciążenie CPU/GPU i liczbę wątków learnera.
Nie zwiększać tylko limitu kredytu: to odkłada zaległości i zmienia wiek polityki.
Jeżeli sprzęt nie nadąża, potrzebna jest kontrola tempa zbierania danych albo
jawnie ustalony niższy wspólny UTD dla porównywanych metod off-policy,
z ponownym pilotem. Nie zmieniać interwału 50 ms osobno na jednym komputerze.
PPO ma inny mechanizm aktualizacji; raportować jego epoki i rollout osobno.

## PR #52 — co jest istotne dla tej kampanii

[PR #52](https://github.com/TrackmaniaRL/TrackmaniaRL/pull/52) przejrzany pod kątem
obecnych konfiguracji; nie został tutaj scalony ani przetestowany w grze.

| Zmiana | Znaczenie dla obecnego planu |
| --- | --- |
| Pomiar i korekcja krzywej skrętu | Wysokie: ustawienia gry mogą zlewać różne akcje. Zweryfikować na każdym komputerze przed pełnymi próbami. |
| Domyślna skala prędkości 0,001 -> 1 | Konfiguracje już jawnie ustawiają 1, więc nie naprawia tych pilotów. |
| Ograniczanie postępu per krok zamiast łącznie | Obecnie limit_progress_by_kinematics=false; ta poprawka nie uzasadnia zmiany nagrody w kampanii. |
| Domyślny limit prędkości 100 -> 280 m/s | YAML jawnie ustawia 100; sam merge go nie zmieni. Nie podnosić bez pomiaru nasycenia na tej mapie. |
| Głowy wartości i TD w float32 | Ważne dla mixed precision; obecna kampania już używa float32. |
| Import ghostów i geometria | Niepotrzebne do obecnych prób bez demonstracji, na zapisanej geometrii. |

Rekomendacja: przyjąć i sprawdzić część dotyczącą sterowania przed zamrożeniem
wersji kampanii. Nie uzależniać startu od importu ghostów. Sama dostępność
krzywej nie naprawia sterowania: trzeba ustawić grę, zmierzyć odpowiedź
i w razie potrzeby skonfigurować korekcję.

Po udostępnieniu komendy z PR: na załadowanej mapie, bez działającego treningu,
`uv run trackmaniarl track check-steering`.
Ujednolicić Analog Sensitivity i Analog Dead Zone; zweryfikować rozróżnialność
13 poziomów oraz ich rzeczywiste wartości, także po ewentualnej korekcji.
Krzywa jest lokalna dla ustawień komputera; nie kopiować jej bez pomiaru.
Nie wykonywać pomiaru równolegle z aktorem sterującym grą.

Po zmianie sterowania lub runtime wykonać krótką jazdę każdego algorytmu.
Zamrozić wspólny commit, konfiguracje i mapę przed pełnymi seedami.
Nie zmieniać kodu uruchomionych pilotów ani omijać fingerprintu przy wznowieniu.
Stare piloty na innym sterowaniu pozostają diagnostyką, nie równoważnymi
próbami nowego protokołu.

## Harmonogram i wynik

Na 2026-10-03 około 22:52: TQC trwa (około 17 tys. kroków), PPO czeka w kolejce.
To zapis chwili przeglądu, nie monitor aktualnego stanu.

Jedna pełna próba to co najmniej 28,4 h jazdy przy 20 Hz; trzy seedy
to co najmniej 85,3 h na algorytm, plus restarty i uczenie.
Jakub ma dwa algorytmy kolejno na jednej grze: co najmniej 170,7 h.
Nie obiecywać wyników pełnej kampanii na jutro.

Oddzielnie porównywać IQN/QR/discrete SAC (78 akcji) oraz TQC/PPO
(sterowanie ciągłe); różnice nie wynikają wyłącznie z algorytmu.
