## 2026-10-08 — fixed combination fits starts but fails greedy-regret protection

The standalone all-state margin probe completed 384 steps in87.47s: coefficient0.1 improves general held reverse-KL to0.09108/0.09931, but both seeds still miss all starts. The subsequent fixed0.25-start-loss plus0.1-margin combination fits all27 held-episode starts in both seeds. General held forward-KL0.06339/0.06397 and reverse-KL0.09081/0.09135 pass the matched-control limits, but greedy regret0.00082685/0.00091310 exceeds both ordinary and margin-only 20% drift guards. The combination is rejected for runtime promotion; start success alone is insufficient. This is frozen-Q diagnostic evidence, not driving or a validated critic.

All original checkpoint/model/Adam pins, actual SHA, STOP and exact owned-process closure checks pass. Evidence includes `greedy-margin.json`, `start-margin-combination.json`, their verification files, and `greedy-tradeoff-rows.json` in `evidence/sd-projlr08-final`. The paired row analysis identifies where greedy regret worsens without rereading or updating any model. Next inspect replay metadata for those rows and recurring action/context tradeoffs before another candidate. Full SD remains BLOCKED; no new pilot is launched.

## 2026-10-08 — repeated greedy-margin reversal; auxiliary probe pending

The matched trajectory audit completed 384 disposable actor steps in 202.56 seconds. Both ordinary-fit seeds reach 100% held-start agreement at step48 and lose it by step64, while general held reverse-KL improves from about0.20 to0.125. The 0.25 mixture has no correct start mode at the sampled trace points; start-only fits starts but fails general calibration. Ordinary endpoints reproduce prior metrics within1e-6. Original checkpoint/model/Adam, exact process closure, pins and STOP verified. This supports a soft-distribution-versus-greedy-mode fitting tradeoff on these saved data, not critic correctness or a driving fix.

A new bounded offline hypothesis is PENDING: an all-state greedy-margin hinge added to the unchanged ordinary forward-KL plus behavior entropy anchor. It uses only the original ordinary fit rows (no added start sampling), detached mean-Q top action and soft-target top-two gap capped at0.1 log-probability, ignores tied Q maxima, coefficients0/.01/.1, seeds17/29,64steps (384total), cap300s. Five numerical hinge invariants and Ruff/mypy pass. Require both seeds 100% held-start agreement AND general held forward-KL/reverse-KL/regret <=1.2xmatched ordinary baseline; preserve all results. No runtime change or new pilot authorized by partial CPU fit; Full remains BLOCKED.

## 2026-10-08 — intermediate actor-margin trajectories pending

A bounded CPU single-thread diagnostic is running on disposable saved-Adam actor copies: ordinary fitting, 0.25 start-loss mixture and start-only fitting, seeds17/29, 64 steps each (384 total), fixed 300-second copy-compute cap. It records intermediate held start margins against actions8/56 and general held calibration at steps0/1/4/8/16/32/48/64. The endpoints already have evidence; the new purpose is to locate the reversal that the zero-update direction audit cannot explain. No new mixture fraction, runtime setting, controller, critic update or persisted model is introduced. Result PENDING; no pilot promotion from partial fitting.

## 2026-10-08 — saved-Adam direction and start-margin audit

The zero-update CPU audit completed in 8.67 seconds. The analytic Adam displacement matches PyTorch on eight numerical controls (saved/fresh state, weight decay and AMSGrad). With ordinary fitting, saved Adam gives a negative local target35-versus8 margin derivative (-0.000995); fresh Adam and clearing only the first moment make it positive (+0.04402/+0.00740). However, all six combinations of ordinary/start-only fitting and saved/fresh/cleared-first-moment Adam worsen target35 versus action56 locally. Even start-only fitting does so initially, although the completed 64-step start-only probe eventually selects35. Lower held start loss therefore does not imply an immediate greedy-margin improvement. These are first-order directional measurements, not actual finite-step outcomes, and do not justify resetting Adam or launching a pilot.

Original checkpoint SHA, model and Adam remain unchanged; all captured exact identities are closed, episode rows match, pins and STOP pass. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/adam-directions.json` and verification. Full SD remains BLOCKED. Next inspect intermediate finite-step margins on matched ordinary, 0.25-mixture and start-only disposable copies to locate the reversal and interference; do not expand the mixture grid blindly.

## 2026-10-08 — zero-update actor gradient audit

The CPU single-thread audit completed in 7.05 seconds with zero optimizer steps. At the original saved actor, tangent gradient cosine is +0.44116 for ordinary fit versus fit starts, +0.42375 for fit starts versus general held rows, and approximately 1 for fit versus held starts. Nine parameter tensors nevertheless have negative tangent dot products (listed in verification); the aggregate result does not support a global initial gradient-conflict explanation. These local gradients are not saved-Adam steps and do not establish compatibility after finite updates or driving quality.

Episode rows match the completed mixture probe. Actual checkpoint SHA, original model and Adam are unchanged; immutable pins and STOP checks pass. The audit exited normally before identity capture; verification records session exit 0 and an empty matching-process inventory, without claiming captured exact identities. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/gradient-conflict.json` and its verification. No new pilot is justified; Full SD remains BLOCKED. Next inspect saved-Adam preconditioning and action-margin directional derivatives without optimizer steps before choosing further fitting experiments.

## 2026-10-08 — completed start-loss mixture diagnostic

The bounded offline probe completed all 384 disposable actor steps in 160.48 seconds. Fractions 0.01, 0.1 and 0.25 passed all general held forward-KL, reverse-KL and greedy-regret limits against their matched ordinary-fit baseline, but every fraction and both seeds retained 0% held-start agreement. No tested fraction qualifies. Lower start fitting error alone does not justify a runtime change or a new pilot.

Original checkpoint SHA, models and saved Adam remain unchanged; both exact owned processes are closed, all immutable pins are valid, and no new STOP is present. Evidence: `evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-start-mixture.json` and its verification. Full SD training remains BLOCKED. Next: inspect parameter-gradient conflict between start and ordinary fitting losses with a zero-update CPU diagnostic before selecting any further fitting experiment. Do not repeat or extend the completed grid.

## 8 October 2026 05:41 UTC - bounded start/general fitting tradeoff running

New explicit --fit-scope mixture compares fixed start-loss fractions.01/.1/.25,seeds17/29,64 projected disposable saved-Adam actor steps each,LR.0009,384 total,300s copy-compute cap. Loss=(1-fraction)*ordinary mixed forward-KL+behavior-anchor loss + fraction*fit-start forward-KL+behavior-anchor loss. Each component draws128 rows with replacement;ordinary mixed RNG is paired with the completed baseline,start RNG is separate. Frozen original mean-Q,alpha.01 and behavior references stay fixed;no critic/target update or persistent policy.

Same episode split and2048 mixed fit/512 general held rows,104 fit starts/27 held starts. Predeclared fit eligibility requires100% held-start agreement and every general-held forwardKL/reverseKL/greedy-regret metric<=1.2 times the matched seed ordinary-mixed result from actor-objectives.json,in both seeds. Report all outcomes;no promotion from only favorable start fit. These reused-replay/frozen-Q criteria do not establish driving quality or critic truth. No runtime replay sampling or model/reward/GNN changes.

## 8 October 2026 05:36 UTC - start-fit capacity/exposure control complete

Dedicated fit to104 fit-episode starts completed128 projected saved-Adam actor steps in27.30s,seeds17/29,LR.0009,forward-KL,unchanged alpha.01 and behavior entropy anchor. Both copies reach100% mean-Q greedy agreement(action35,gas1) on all27 held-episode starts,zero greedy regret,forwardKL.010035/reverseKL.016348. The actor can fit this saved initial-state preference;short mixed-probe failure does not establish an architecture/capacity bottleneck. Held starts are similar observations already encountered during original training,not unseen real driving.

General held replay reverseKL increases from original.471377 to.716892/.716887 despite forwardKL declining.375595 to.329989/.329986 and greedy regret declining.008611 to.005998. Start-only fitting therefore loses general distribution calibration and is not a runtime candidate. No proof that frozen Q values are correct,no driving claim,no model/reward/GNN/replay change.

Original checkpoint/model/Adam unchanged,actualSHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,all exact owned probe processes closed,immutable pins valid,no changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-start-fit.json and actor-start-fit-verification.json. Explicit --fit-scope starts mode is bounded180s and128steps;default mixed behavior unchanged. Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass;real split disjointness and immutable-input assertions pass. No offline process remains,fullBLOCKED,automationACTIVE5min.

Next offline diagnostic may test a fixed mixed/start loss-mixture grid .01/.1/.25 on disposable projected actor/savedAdam copies,paired seeds64steps,against the completed ordinary mixed fit. Require held-start agreement and both-seed general-held forwardKL/reverseKL/greedy-regret no more than20% worse than the matched ordinary-mixed result. This tests a fitting tradeoff only;no automatic runtime replay reweighting or fresh pilot until scoped evidence is reviewed.

## 8 October 2026 05:32 UTC - zero-update start coverage audit

The diagnostic fit sample contains3 episode-first observations out of2048(.1465%),held sample1/512. With128 draws per step and64 steps,the fit distribution yields12 expected start draws per copy. This quantifies limited exposure in the short offline probe;it does not reconstruct or establish insufficient start sampling in actual training. Saved replay has131 starts among145424 transitions. All131 starts form9 exact decoded observation hashes with small context/physics differences;none of the sampled nonstart rows exactly aliases any start. This is a sampled exact-identity check,not proof of a fully Markov representation or absence of near-aliases.

Original actor start top action8 probability.032694 with top-two gap.0005497. Mean-Q soft target top action35 probability.058295,second action56 probability.047109,gap.011187;Q gap.002131,alpha.01,soft entropy4.05041. Thus the target has an identifiable gas-action preference despite high entropy. Shared no-gas choices after short mixed-sample copy fitting cannot alone establish inability to represent the start preference.

New audit_sd_sac_start_coverage.py: Ruff/boundary-scoped mypy pass,real CPUidle1thread inference completed,zero optimizer/controller updates,checkpoint fingerprint/SHA/model immutability verified. Immutable source pins valid/no changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/start-coverage.json. No offline process running,no new pilot,fullBLOCKED,automationACTIVE5min. Next bounded offline capacity/exposure control: fit disposable projected actor copies to fit-episode start rows directly against unchanged mean-Q/alpha/behavior anchor,compare held-episode starts and general held rows;paired seeds,savedAdam,strict fixed cap. This is a representation/fitting diagnostic,not permission to alter replay sampling or claim driving improvement.

## 8 October 2026 05:25 UTC - fresh-Adam control complete; no objective promotion

The paired fresh-Adam control completed512 projected actor-copy steps in113.53s. AtLR.0009,SAC held reverseKL.078282/.072759 is close to forward-KL.075557/.074223; SAC greedy agreement64.65/64.84% remains below forward76.76/76.37%,and greedy regret.000963/.000879 exceeds forward.000522/.000596. Resetting disposable optimizer history removes much of the saved-Adam SAC deficit,so the earlier inherited-Adam comparison cannot establish that SAC is intrinsically worse.

Both fresh objectives atLR.0009 choose action56(no gas) on all131 saved starts,with zero agreement against mean-Q greedy action35(gas1) and regret.002131; atLR.0001 both choose action3,also zero agreement. Neither comparison supports an objective-only runtime fix or another identical fast-actor pilot. Reused replay,frozen critics and only64 steps limit interpretation; no capacity/architecture conclusion or claim about driving.

Original CP/model/Adam unchanged,all exact probe processes closed,actual CP SHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,immutable pins valid,no changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/actor-objectives-fresh-adam.json and actor-objectives-fresh-adam-verification.json. No offline process remains,no new pilot launched,fullBLOCKED,automationACTIVE5min. Next zero-update diagnostic: quantify start-state fit coverage,observation aliasing and actor/soft-target top-action probability margins; distinguish sampling/generalization from fitting ability before another optimizer probe.

## 8 October 2026 05:20 UTC - saved-Adam actor objective result and fresh control

All512 projected actor-copy steps completed in113.14s; original checkpoint/model/saved Adam unchanged,all exact probe identities closed,actual CP SHA and immutable pins valid,no changed STOP. On held episodes,forward-KL atLR.0009 gives agreement76.95/77.15%,regret.000536/.000518,reverseKL.124906/.124686. Canonical SAC at the same LR and inherited Adam gives agreement21.68/22.27%,regret.007336/.007167,reverseKL.653937/.608725 versus baseline.471377. AtLR.0001,SAC reverseKL.469171/.468223 barely improves baseline. All variants still have zero mean-Q greedy agreement on saved starts; no objective promoted and no new runtime pilot.

This is not a clean comparison of objectives trained from scratch: inherited Adam moments were accumulated under forward-KL,whose current local logit gradients are much larger. A paired fresh-Adam control is therefore now running with identical original actor,Q,alpha,entropy anchor,episode split,seeds,LR grid,64 steps per cell and projection. Explicit --adam-state fresh changes only disposable optimizer initialization; saved mode remains default. Output actor-objectives-fresh-adam.json is new,never overwrites saved-Adam evidence.

## 8 October 2026 05:16 UTC - actor objective copy comparison running

New diagnostic probe_sd_sac_actor_objectives.py compares forward-KL versus canonical SAC on identical frozen mean-Q,alpha,behavior entropy references and whole-episode fit/held rows. Each objective uses actorLR.0001/.0009 and seeds17/29,64 projected saved-Adam actor-copy steps per cell,512 total,300s copy-compute cap. Saved checkpoint/model/optimizer remain originals; no controller/runtime learner/new pilot. Fixed-Q fitting cannot establish critic correctness or driving.

Initial held logit gradients differ in magnitude and direction: forward norm.006390,SAC.00009552,cosine.76136. Unchanged entropy-anchor gradient relative norm is.00213 versus.14257. These are local logit gradients,not full parameter gradients or Adam step sizes; no conclusion about learning rate follows directly. Metrics include both KL directions,SAC objective,expected Q,greedy agreement/regret,entropy and per-row actions. Compare matched-seed/LR results only after completion; no objective promotion from partial results.

Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass. Existing objective helpers match runtime forward cross-entropy and canonical SAC up to a state-only Q baseline. Active CPU child80212 created1791436551.8764615 IDLE64,wrapper39824 created1791436551.862483. Exec66735,BASE/sd-projlr08-audit/actor-objectives.json and actor-objectives-processes.json.

## 8 October 2026 05:12 UTC - projected terminal calibration rejected

Offline projected critic/saved-Adam copy probe completed all 384 steps in336.33s within600s cap. Both lambda0 baselines pass the held nonterminal drift guard. Every tested extra terminal weight(.01,.1,1) fails that guard in both seeds. At lambda.01,held terminal MAE improves from lambda0 4.994/5.013 to4.551/4.598,while held nonterminal MAE worsens to.113856/.115229 against the fixed limit.085662. Higher weights worsen nonterminal error further(.429/.434 and.913/1.159).

Whole-episode paired bootstrap with three-candidate family adjustment gives positive terminal-error reductions versus lambda0: .01 interval[.3456,.5213],.1[1.6123,2.2928],1[2.9242,4.7702]. Both-seed terminal gains also beat the initial baseline,but none qualifies because all nonzero weights fail the predeclared drift guard. This frozen-target reused-replay diagnostic does not establish driving quality; no terminal weighting promoted and no new pilot launched.

Final assertions confirm original checkpoint,models and saved Adam unchanged. Independent actual checkpoint SHA f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53,all probe exactPID/ctime closed,immutable pins valid,no new/changed STOP. Evidence: evidence/sd-projlr08-final/projected-calibration.json and projected-calibration-verification.json. Full BLOCKED;automationACTIVE5min. Next scoped offline hypothesis: inspect actor objective gradients and compare projected forward-KL/canonical SAC copies against identical frozen mean-Q targets with episode-held rows and saved Adam. No runtime setting change justified yet.

## 8 October 2026 05:08 UTC - projected critic copy probe running

New standalone probe_sd_sac_projected_calibration.py is executing offline on CPU idle/single-thread against immutable CP33856 f2b0d4aa942606c1b6c0c058942d7e4e0f816a909ea17733635bf38ab0d40f53. Only independent q1/q2 and saved critic Adam copies receive updates; saved actor,target critics,alpha and Bellman targets remain frozen. Projection after each copied Adam step; no Polyak update. No game controller/runtime learner/new training run.

Fixed whole-episode fit/held split, all available eligible terminal rows plus1024 sampled nonterminals per split. Stratified128+128 sampling restores empirical fit terminal prevalence for the clipped Bellman baseline; extra terminal MSE lambda0/.01/.1/1,seeds17/29,48 steps each,384 total,600s copy-compute cap. Baseline held terminal MAE5.01630,held nonterminal0.071385; relative20% guard<=0.085662. Both completed lambda0 copies pass guard and leave terminal error near baseline. Nonzero-grid result pending; do not infer success or launch a candidate from partial output.

Three focused numerical tests pass (empirical class weighting,explicit terminal contribution,clipped-versus-extra gradient). Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass. Process receipts and incremental results: BASE/sd-projlr08-audit/projected-calibration-processes.json and projected-calibration.json. AutomationACTIVE5min; poll existing execsession37505 or inspect recorded exactPID/ctime,never start a duplicate. Candidate interpretation requires both seed guards,held-terminal paired comparison against lambda0 and initial baseline,and original checkpoint/model/Adam immutability. Full remains BLOCKED.

## 8 October 2026 05:01 UTC - mean/min and target-clipping audit

Completed zero-update CPU idle/single-thread inference on both immutable projected checkpoints. The current mean-Q actor target ranks action35 (gas1) first on all131 saved starts; Q1 and Q2 individually rank no-gas actions56/62 first. Therefore the preceding no-gas finding for the individual critics does not mean their averaged actor target also prefers no gas. Mean-Q gas mass56.03%,best-gas advantage0.00213; min-Q gas mass51.00%,best-gas advantage-0.00176. Predecessor mean-Q gas mass93.77%,advantage0.02486. These are different saved replay states,not a paired causal comparison. Switching actor targets to min-Q is not supported as a fix for this failed start behavior.

Terminal clipping blocks the selected loss branch for only1/130 samples per critic (0.77%) in the current checkpoint,versus0/181 and1/181 previously. Nonterminal blocked fractions0%. This checkpoint snapshot does not explain terminal MAE5.53 through pervasive clipped gradients and cannot reconstruct historical gradients. Terminal bootstrap and mean-minus-min target gap are exactly0; terminal targets match immediate rewards. Nonterminal mean-minus-min target gap0.01718 on1024 rows,entropy bootstrap0.03785. These counterfactual targets do not establish true Q values.

New runnable audit: audit_sd_sac_target_calibration.py. Ruff and boundary-scoped mypy pass; two real CPU inference executions pass fingerprint/SHA/model immutability checks. Terminal-zero-bootstrap,target-equals-reward,and mean>=min invariants pass. No optimizer/controller/training run created. Evidence: [current](evidence/sd-projlr08-final/target-calibration.json),[predecessor](evidence/sd-projlr08-final/predecessor-target-calibration.json).

Next diagnostic remains offline: test whether projected disposable critic+savedAdam copies can reduce episode-held terminal error while preserving fixed nonterminal Bellman targets under a relative20% drift guard; include an unmodified-loss baseline and paired seeds. Earlier unprojected checkpoint weighting probes failed the guard; do not promote terminal weighting or claim an architecture bottleneck. Only a positive,repeatable scoped result can justify a fresh pilot. Current sd-projlr08 remains closed;full BLOCKED;automationACTIVE5min. No new controller launched.

## 8 October 2026 — pilots scheduled from 01:30 Warsaw

New direct human authorization resumes justified bounded SD-SAC tests and monitoring.
First queue sd-proj08 is PREPARED_NOT_LAUNCHED on frozen9821c23e, fresh projection
control; live game readiness and driving remain unverified. Existing heartbeat is
ACTIVE for01:30 and will switch to5-minute checks, then60-minute checks after three
healthy observations spanning15 minutes. Actual guard deadlines remain binding.
Full training remains BLOCKED; no automatic full launch. See
[scheduled pilot handoff](SD_SAC_SCHEDULE_20261008.md). Earlier PAUSED/offline-only
statements below describe historical scopes, superseded only by this authorization.

Offline optimizer repair 2026-10-07: SD-SAC now projects hyperspherical weights after
critic/actor Adam and before Polyak; old unprojected Adam contract cannot resume.
Saved raw row norms reached4.20. Fixed-Q actor copies at unchangedalpha.01 improved
held agreement84.59/88.58% to92.20/93.53% with projection, not proof of driving/Q truth.
Small terminal-weight/head-only controls selected no statistically supported repair
under the nonterminal drift guard. Fresh sd-sac-projected-s17.yaml PREPARED_NOT_LAUNCHED;
no new run/controller/game/network publication.176 tests/Ruff/mypy passed,1260pins

All held-terminal reductions have positive family-adjusted paired intervals,

held terminal MAE3.3102 to0.2463/0.2500 but raised nonterminal residual0.1210 to
11.8800/11.9412, so it is rejected as a repair. Separate scalar-tensor replay-read

# SD-SAC exact-source continuation and bounded repair loops — 2026-10-07

The latest direct human instruction authorizes sensible autonomous repair,
bounded-test and diagnosis loops until the SD-SAC driving gate and handoff are
complete. Full training never starts automatically. New or modified STOP wins.
Every attempt has a separate immutable plan and time limit; used queues never
restart and running attempts never gain extra time. Changed-code checkpoint
resume, replay reset and shared-reward changes remain forbidden.

was verified running by API. Actor registered and collecting; this is launch
evidence, not a useful-driving result. No UI or second controller during the run.

## Preserved failure and verification

Resume01 failed before game controller or learner: Windows refused a temporary
checkpoint decompression path exceeding its length limit. Its failure log,
status and normal deadline closure (forced[]) are preserved; it is never
restarted. A separate short-path full-state clone was prepared directly from
the original saved checkpoint and journal. Its actual codec load passed.
The first new validator drafts rejected serialization defaults and an incorrect
import/runtime invocation; these external-helper issues were corrected before
launch. Final40 contract/preparation tests and validate-only passed on exact
frozen cwd/PYTHONPATH. No frozen/main-source edits were made for these failures.
Actual preflight ready:10ms race time,33fields,correctUID,58countdown reads.

Prepared receipts are historical preparation records, not live launch status.
Use actual launch/status/effective-deadline and events. Source freeze includes
the initial cloned checkpoint as a launch input pin; normal retention may later
remove that cloned input after full restore. Its initial SHA remains recorded;
the original checkpoint and immutable source/helper/evidence pins must stay
unchanged. New run checkpoints/journal are legitimate training outputs.

## Gate and next decision

Require complete145408 training, finite checkpoint, matching source fingerprint
and SHA, exact update accounting and drained credit; ten complete correct-map
trials, all timing maxima<=100ms, no controller/telemetry errors, reported skips
and at least eight finishes. FullSD stays BLOCKED until this actual gate.
Training/warmup progress and CPU tests do not establish improved driving.
Comparable earlier training data did not show a demonstrated improvement.
QR29/30median54.3PASS is preserved and never rerun for this repair.

On failure preserve evidence, save/close all owned PID/ctime identities and
release the shared mutex before diagnosing and considering a new bounded test.
Never resume a checkpoint under changed source. On PASS verify manual full
generator, seed17/29/43 YAML, guard and setup; publish an honest manual handoff
without starting full training. Monitor remains ACTIVE for the authorized loops,
silent while healthy; pause only after the completed objective or explicit STOP.
