## 2026-10-07 11:55 Warsaw — slow training COMPLETE, ten-trial evaluation ACTIVE

The new human instruction reauthorizes SD-SAC repair/test loops and prioritizes SD-SAC
before other algorithms. Historical STOP files remain preserved with exact SHA/mtime
exemptions; a new or changed STOP always wins.

Actual saved-policy evaluation sd-e08 completed normally: **2/10 finishes**, median
149.24s, mean progress57.836355%. Ten complete correct-UID trials; timing, SHA and
controller/telemetry checks passed, skips reported. All observed owned identities
closed, mutex free, immutable pins unchanged. This is improved driving versus earlier
0/10 results, but it fails the>=8/10 gate and uses incomplete training.
Evidence: BASE/sd-e08/post-closure-verification.json and its evaluation artifact.

## 2026-10-06 — no-movement diagnosis and offline corrective variant

After “no to ogarnij to”, audited the preserved CP33866 in exact frozen e50b0b02,
CPU only, no controller or learner updates. Across128 recorded starts actor argmax
was always action24=[gas0,brake0,steer-1/3], maxprob0.03947, entropy4.16891;
critic preferred56, agreement0%. This explains why this greedy policy can remain
stationary; the old evaluation did not persist issued commands, so actual backend
execution cannot be reconstructed. It was still a valid driving FAIL0/10.

All137 replay terminal states had mean Q12.368 vs reward-2.046, MAE14.414;
terminal fraction0.09418%, clipped loss blocked9.489% of terminal gradients.
Added explicit optional terminal_value_loss_coefficient (default0 preserves SD-SAC)
to anchor selected true-terminal actions directly to known rewards, normalized
within terminal samples, without bootstrap or clipping. Truncations excluded;
importance weights honored; checkpoint options prohibit changing this objective
on resume. It is an experimental critic objective, NOT a proven driving fix.
Added terminal TD error sum/count diagnostics and issued-control histogram,
measurement completeness and gas mean in future evaluation artifacts. Missing
commands are unknown, not zero gas; commands do not prove game acknowledgement.

Offline independent critic copies,200 CPU regression steps, fixed old bootstrap:
coefficient0 terminalMAE13.921/nonterminalTDMAE0.138;
coefficient1 terminalMAE3.009/nonterminalTDMAE1.995. This tradeoff must remain visible.
Head-only300step probe improved terminalMAE14.105 to13.992 only. Training-data
calibration and frozen targets cannot establish ranking, policy quality or driving.
113 CPU tests, Ruff and mypy passed. No saved model, reward, replay or frozen source
was edited; no game test, evaluation or new pilot launched. Evidence in
BASE/sd-sac-stability-no-movement-audit-20261006. FullSD BLOCKED; automation stays
PAUSED. Fresh training/test requires a new direct human instruction.

## 2026-10-06 17:30 Warsaw — evaluation completed; driving gate FAIL

This supersedes the earlier pre-evaluation failure and paused snapshot below.
After the human instruction “no to ogarniaj”, supervision was repaired and the
already authorized ten trials were completed on the preserved checkpoint,
without repeating training. New queue: queue-sd-sac-stability-eval-recovery01-20261006.
Evaluation ended 15:27:46.118406 UTC; guard normal closure 15:27:46.483867 UTC,

Recovery performed zero learner updates. Frozen e50b0b02 source and helper hashes verified.
Evidence: the new queue's sd-sac-repair-decision.json, post-evaluation-receipt.json,
deadline-closure.json and actual benchmark evaluation.json.

Supervision repair f68cd0e2 adds bounded identity-aware polling of cached process
objects, avoiding wait-handle reopening; descendants now persist PID plus creation
time. Nine module tests and eleven recovery/supervision regression tests passed;
Ruff passed; type checking passed with only missing psutil stubs ignored.
The original AccessDenied OS cause remains unproven; no system process was modified.
The recovery completed under the repaired supervisor, but did not repair driving.

The experimental soft_q_forward_kl stability variant is NOT qualified for full
SD-SAC or three seeds. QR PASS29/30 median54.3s remains preserved.
Automation PAUSED after completion. No new pilot, training or evaluation without
another direct human instruction. Offline diagnosis may inspect why a single
unchanging action produced no progress; its cause is not yet demonstrated.

## Poprawki kodu SD-SAC po nowym poleceniu człowieka — 6 października 2026

## 2026-10-06 17:12 Warsaw — training complete; queue failed before evaluation

fingerprint match, finite learner state, earned=accounted33866.5 and credit0.5,
drained and complete. No learner was instantiated or updated for this validation.

Queue failed2026-10-06T15:12:40.466247UTC with `psutil.AccessDenied(pid59824)`

The exact OS-level cause is unproven. Guard normal closure15:12:40.945327UTC,
forced[], all pinned owned processes closed and shared controller mutex free.
Current PID59824 belongs to svchost; the old descendant creation-time identity
was not persisted. PID reuse is plausible but unproven, and that system process
was not modified. W&B ufoxma8r API finished. Original evidence/helpers,
checkpoint and original deadlines are unchanged. This queue is never restarted.

Driving evaluation NEVER STARTED: no evaluation YAML/history/artifact or driving
score. This is neither0/10 nor a gate PASS. Full SD-SAC remains BLOCKED, QR
PASS29/30 median54.3s preserved. No new pilot/training/evaluation was started.
Monitoring is being paused on completion of this report; a further test requires
new direct human authorization. Recommended offline harness repair: bounded
PID-and-creation-time liveness checks instead of waiting on disappeared process
handles; unknown live identities must continue to block controller handoff.

## 2026-10-06 14:55 Warsaw — one repaired experimental pilot active

Latest direct instruction: “Jak wszystko naprawisz odpal pilot SD SAC na nowo”.
The earlier human STOP and incomplete checkpoint are preserved; this is a new run
from zero, with no checkpoint or replay resume. Only this pilot and its ten greedy
evaluations are authorized; no automatic following pilot or full training.

`C:/Users/szulc/.codex/worktrees/tmrl-sd-sac-stability-runtime/AITrackmania`.
The explicit experimental variant uses soft-Q forward-KL actor fitting, actor
LR0.0003, temperature LR0.0001 and alpha bounds[0.01,0.2]. Target entropy0.8,
beta0.0005, critic LR0.0003, reward/map/model/GNN/replay/UTD remain unchanged.
Multiple stability controls change together; this pilot cannot isolate their
individual effects or establish canonical SD-SAC performance.

Code regressions: 93 CPU checks including the formerly skipped synthetic loops
passed, then the expanded behavior-entropy module (including both canonical and
forward-KL terminal learning and checkpoint round-trip) passed16 checks. Ruff
passed; 30 external guard/candidate/closure checks and validate-only passed.
This is code evidence, not driving qualification.

skips3120/max6; checkpoint SHA niezmieniony. Wszystkie warunki techniczne bramki
spełnione, jazda FAIL. Wynik target1.2 gorszy niż target.8 beta.0005 (48.4221%).

Audyt CPU exact frozen4706, 1024 replay states, threads2/CUDA-1, bez kontrolera
ani aktualizacji learnera: na starcie aktor wybiera akcję5 (pełny skręt z brake tap)
z prawdopodobieństwem około .969, krytyk akcję41 (prosto z brake tap).
1000 kroków niezależnej kopii głowy przy stałym Q podniosło zgodność aktor/Q
z .340 do .804/.807 dla beta0/.0005. Usunięcie kotwicy daje podobny wynik;
próba nie zapisuje polityki i nie dowodzi poprawności krytyka ani jakości jazdy.

Następna hipoteza: wrócić do lepszego target.8/beta.0005 i przetestować wyłącznie
szybsze dopasowanie aktora (actor LR9e-4 zamiast3e-4). Krytyk i temperatura
zachowają LR3e-4. Dodano opcjonalny parametr SD-SAC z domyślnym zachowaniem

`queue-sd-sac-target120-eval-recovery01-20261006` nie została uruchomiona:
brak launch receipt, learnera, kontrolera i oceny. Kontrola po HARD nie wykazała
procesów Python ani nasłuchu telemetrycznego 9000/9001. Nie przedłużono limitu.
To **brak wyniku jazdy**, nie 0/10; checkpoint 33859 i kompletne dowody treningu zachowane.

Pulpit i gra zostały wcześniej przywrócone, oryginalna mapa załadowana w walidacji.
Aktualną blokadą jest odrzucenie TrackmaniaRL_Connect przez Openplanet:
`Plugin is not suitable for the current signature mode. It requires School mode.`
Poproszono o ręczne przywrócenie School mode i załadowanie wtyczki; ustawienia

pomija bezwarunkowe potwierdzenie finish-screen, łączy telemetrię po resecie
i odrzuca brak powrotu na start (race_time > 2500 ms). Osobny test live potwierdził
reset do 210 ms; właściwy QR preflight do **240 ms**, właściwy UID i 33 pola.
Nie udowodniono, który element dawnego menu spowodował utratę gracza.
Zmiany dotyczą wyłącznie zewnętrznych helperów; zamrożone algorytmy są niezmienione.
Pięć testów kontraktu preflight, 31 testów nadzoru QR i 20 SD-SAC przeszło;
oba plany przeszły validate-only.

QR działa w `queue-qr-repair-retry01-20261005`: launcher 43888 / runner 51928,
train launcher 58120, learner 53772, actor 53428; W&B **5x4ydddg online**.
Fresh run `tmrl-repair-qr-loss-sum-s17-retry01` zbiera rollouts, bez gotowego wyniku.

Plan zachowuje 145408 kroków / max 8100 s i 30 greedy / max 2700 s,
zamrożony kod `c4ec36a0`. Bramka pozostaje >=29/30 i mediana <=56,915 s,
pełny/drained/accounted checkpoint, finite/fingerprint/SHA, ważny timing max100 ms,
brak błędów i raport pominiętych ramek. Naprawa matematyczna nie gwarantuje jazdy.

Nowy SD-SAC `queue-sd-sac-anchor005-retry01-20261005`: launcher 58956 /
waiter 30764, created_time 1791212631.7032077; czeka **bez kontrolera i launch.json**.
Przypina nowy QR plan/rezerwację, wymaga obu ukończonych etapów, pełnego finite/drained
checkpointu, 30 ocen z matching SHA, normalnego zamknięcia guardu/procesów,
braku STOP i wolnego mutexu. Pasywne oczekiwanie kończy się **20:38:16 Warsaw**.

Aktualne wskaźniki active-queue/pending-queue/sd-sac-pending-queue opisują te nowe próby;

autoryzowanego celu SD-SAC albo jawnego STOP. Żadnych automatycznych miesięcznych
startów, zmian nagrody, fingerprint override ani wznawiania starych checkpointów.


## Aktualny wynik i blokada środowiska — 5 października 15:29 Warsaw

Ta aktualizacja zastępuje poniższe historyczne informacje o działającym PPO
i oczekujących procesach. PPO ukończył diagnostyczny uczony prefix cp70:
143360 kroków / 70 aktualizacji, finite i zgodny fingerprint; to nie jest pełny trening.
Dziesięć ocen dało **3/10 met**, medianę 55,34 s wyłącznie ukończonych prób.
Wszystkie pomiary timingu 6681/6681 są ważne, max 60 / p99 50 ms, bez błędów;
10778 pominiętych ramek, max 5. Timing treningu poprawił się do max 70 ms.
Skuteczność jazdy nadal nie przechodzi progu 8/10; krótszy czas trzech finisherów
nie dowodzi poprawy polityki względem wcześniejszego 8/10. Nie odblokowano pełnego startu.

QR przejął kolejkę o 15:07:14, lecz preflight zakończył się o 15:07:31:
po resecie nie otrzymano ramki telemetrii w 10 s. **Nie powstał learner, checkpoint
ani katalog treningu QR.** Jego procesy i guard zamknęły się normalnie, bez forcekill.
Oczekujący SD-SAC beta 0,005 prawidłowo przerwał przejęcie po awarii QR i również
nie rozpoczął treningu. Poprzedni SD-SAC pozostaje 0/10 i full BLOCKED.

Osobny ograniczony probe połączenia dopiero po resecie też zakończył się timeoutem.
Pięć testów kontraktu z atrapami przeszło; nie są dowodem usunięcia rzeczywistej awarii.
OpenPlanet potwierdza właściwy UID, ale `confirm_ready` zwraca `player_not_ready`.
Okno gry pokazuje przejazd bez HUD-u; dostępne próby wejścia do menu nie przywróciły
lokalnego gracza. Poproszono użytkownika o ponowne uruchomienie walidacji mapy.

Dowody są w `artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/qr-preflight-recovery-20261005/`
(`recovery-status.json`, `session-state.json`, `probe.log`, archiwum pierwotnej awarii).
Wskaźnik active-queue nadal opisuje zakończoną awarią QR, a nie żywy kontroler;
zawsze czytaj status kolejki. Wszystkie obserwowane procesy zamknięto.
Nie uruchamiaj ponownie użytych runnerów ani zakończonych etapów. Ewentualne wznowienie
wyłącznie pozostałego QR wymaga osobnego jawnego recovery, gotowej telemetrii,
braku nowego STOP i wolnego mutexu, z zachowaniem pierwotnego **SAVE 18:27:14 /
HARD 18:37:14 Warsaw**. Limit nie zaczyna się ponownie od recovery.
Nowa rezerwacja SD-SAC musi wskazywać rzeczywistego poprawnie zakończonego poprzednika.
Cel dalszej naprawy SD-SAC i monitor ACTIVE pozostają obowiązujące; żadnych automatycznych
miesięcznych startów, zmian wspólnej nagrody ani aktualizacji zamrożonych źródeł.


## Dalsza naprawa SD-SAC — 5 października 13:33 Warsaw

Użytkownik polecił: „No to poprawiaj SD SAC tak długo aż będzie sensowny”.
Nadzór pozostaje ACTIVE również po samym PPO/QR, jeśli SD-SAC nie spełni bramki.
Ostatni SD-SAC nadal ma **0/10 met** i niepełny budżet; pełne treningi są zablokowane.

Audyt CPU zgodnego checkpointu na 1024 stanach wykazał, że przy beta 0,5 kara
utrzymująca entropię zachowania znosi niemal cały gradient preferencji wartości
(cosinus −0,9295; udział zniesiony 1,0059). To lokalna diagnoza, nie dowód błędu
matematycznego całego algorytmu. Nowa hipoteza zmienia tylko beta **0,5 → 0,005**;
wspólna nagroda, model, target entropy 0,8 i budżet 145408 pozostają takie same.
Kod dodaje diagnostykę prawdopodobieństw akcji i zgodności z krytykami oraz
usuwa zbędny graf krytyków z kroku aktora, zachowując cel i gradient aktora.

Nowy pilot faktycznie oczekuje w `queue-sd-sac-anchor005-20261005`:
**launcher 48368 / waiter 57588**, created_time 1791199959.0079837, bez kontrolera
i `launch.json`. `sd-sac-pending-queue.json` wskazuje rezerwację; właściwy stan
odczytuje się z kolejki. Frozen runtime `tmrl-sd-sac-anchor-runtime` ma źródła
`4706a06b0eea5ba3fe0d2c6aa1ad641ed29aca84`, opublikowane atomowo na obu branchach.

Kolejność pozostaje **PPO → QR → nowy SD-SAC**. PPO działał o 13:33 online:
49152 kroki / 24 pełne aktualizacje rolloutu, finite, bez awarii.
Terminy PPO i QR oraz ich zamrożone źródła są bez zmian. SD-SAC przejmuje dopiero
po normalnym końcu QR, pełnym rozliczonym checkpointcie QR, 30 ocenach, zamknięciu
procesów i guardu, braku STOP i wolnym mutexie. Pasywne oczekiwanie ma limit
**20:09 Warsaw**; nie uruchamia learnera. Po faktycznym starcie SD-SAC:
trening maks. 10800 s, 10 greedy maks. 2100 s, całe zadanie maks. **4 h**,
SAVE 600 s przed HARD. Właściwe daty pojawią się w jego `launch.json`.

Przeszło **106 testów uczenia, 20 testów nadzoru, 42 schematy**, Ruff, mypy
zmienionego źródła i standardowy CPU update/zstd roundtrip rzeczywistej kompozycji
GNN / 78 akcji. To dowody poprawności technicznej, nie nowy wynik jazdy.
Bramka pozostaje: pełny budżet, drained/accounted credit, finite/fingerprint/SHA,
10 kompletnych ważnych prób, **co najmniej 8/10 met**, max 100 ms, brak błędów,
raport pominiętych ramek. Nieudany wynik zachowujemy i diagnozujemy kolejną
uzasadnioną hipotezę w osobnym ograniczonym świeżym pilocie; bez automatycznych
pełnych treningów i bez deklaracji globalnej optymalności lub kwalifikacji 3 seedów.

Poniższa sekcja z 12:50 zachowuje wcześniejszy wynik i dowody.

## Nowy wynik SD-SAC i przejęcie QR — 5 października 12:50 Warsaw

Świeży SD-SAC target0,8 / beta0,5 / behavior nie zaliczył bramki: **0/10 met**,
średnio **3,552% trasy**. Wszystkie 10 prób mają ważny timing, 1961/1961 pomiarów,
max/p99 50 ms, brak błędów kontrolera i telemetrii; 2440 pominiętych ramek,
maksimum 5. Nie ma potwierdzonej poprawy skuteczności jazdy. Pełny SD-SAC
pozostaje zablokowany, generator i konfiguracje pełnych treningów bez promocji.

Pilot zakończono przez limit czasu o 12:44:29 Warsaw: **135406/145408 kroków**,
30775 aktualizacji, credit576,5, earned=accounted31351,5. Checkpoint jest finite
z potwierdzonym fingerprintem/SHA, ale budżet jest niepełny i credit nie został
wyczerpany. To ograniczenie testu, nie pełny ukończony trening. SHA checkpointu:
`6fdab80112a7e27a5bfd65cd98e01eb20297f647b4b7258045ea726e82154175`.
Dowody: `queue-ppo-sd-sac-repair-20261005/sd-sac-completion.json`,

`tmrl-repair-diag-sd-sac-s17-benchmark-20261005T104448532426/evaluation.json`.

PPO rozpoczął świeży prefix o **12:47:13 Warsaw**, PID54168, W&B `yygy62p7` online.
Oceniamy zachowany pełny uczony cp70/143360 i 10 przejazdów zgodnie z protokołem.
SAVE16:19/HARD16:29 poprzedniej fazy pozostają bez zmian.

Przed rozpoczęciem QR wykryto dodatkowy błąd pomocnika przekazania kolejki:
czytał `sd-sac-evaluation.json` / `ppo-evaluation.json`, choć poprzednik zapisuje
`eval-sd-sac-evaluation.json` / `eval-ppo-evaluation.json`. Zatrzymano wyłącznie
pasywny pomocnik, przed jakimkolwiek etapem QR, zachowano snapshot w
`passive-wait-handoff-repair-02` i poprawiono nazwy odczytu. Nowa regresja
odtworzyła błąd; po poprawce **31 testów nadzoru** przeszło, w tym rzeczywisty
kontrakt nazw i odrzucanie niepełnego prefixu / brakujących prób / niefinite cp.
Ruff helperów i validate-only planu przeszły.

QR ponownie oczekuje: **launcher8384 / waiter55608**, bez kontrolera i bez
`launch.json` QR. `passive-handoff-recovery.json` i `pending-queue.json` wskazują
nową tożsamość. Źródła QR c4ec36a0 i SD-SAC/PPO266e2629 bez zmian; poprzednik nie
był restartowany. Warunki przejęcia, deadline oczekiwania16:34, własny limitQR
3h30 od rzeczywistego startu i bramki29/30 / mediana≤56,915s pozostają niezmienione.
Matematyczna poprawka QR nadal wymaga świeżego wyniku w grze. Monitor ACTIVE.

Poniższe sekcje zachowują wcześniejsze stany i dowody.

## Przywrócone oczekiwanie QR — 5 października 12:21 Warsaw

Pomocnik oczekujący QR zakończył się o 12:09 z `PermissionError` podczas odczytu
`status.json` poprzedniej kolejki. QR nie otworzył kontrolera, nie rozpoczął
treningu ani oceny. Zachowano pierwotny błąd, logi, rezerwację i helpery w
`queue-qr-repair-20261005/passive-wait-recovery-01`; zapis w
`passive-recovery.json` potwierdza zamknięcie starego pomocnika i brak etapów QR.

Poprawiono tylko odczyty zewnętrznego pomocnika QR i jego przyszłego guardu:
ponawianie trwa najwyżej 5 s, a trwały błąd nadal przerywa pracę. Wszystkie
26 testów CPU nadzoru przeszło, w tym 5 nowych regresji: rzeczywista wyłączna
blokada pliku Windows, ograniczony trwały błąd uprawnień, przerwa podmiany pliku,
odrzucenie uszkodzonego JSON i niedozwolonego długiego ponawiania. Walidacja
planu i Ruff helperów przeszły. Poprzednie 32 testy źródeł i próba QR64 update /
zstd roundtrip pozostają zachowanymi dowodami, nie nowym wynikiem jazdy.

Oczekiwanie przywrócono: launcher **60600**, runner **60380**,
`waiting_for_predecessor`, pusty `runner.err`, bez `launch.json` QR.
`pending-queue.json` wskazuje nową tożsamość; aktywna kolejka pozostaje SD-SAC/PPO
z runnerem 61144 i guardem 3356. Nie zmieniono jej źródeł, helperów ani etapów.
Zamrożone runtime QR c4ec36a0 oraz SD-SAC/PPO 266e2629 pozostały bez zmian.

Zakres i warunki przejęcia są niezmienione: wszystkie cztery etapy poprzednika,
pełny uczony prefix PPO i 10+10 ocen, zamknięte procesy, wolna wspólna blokada,
brak nowego STOP. Oczekiwanie kończy się najpóźniej o 16:34 Warsaw. QR nadal ma
własne 3 godz. 30 min od rzeczywistego startu, SAVE 10 min przed HARD i wcześniej
zapisane bramki 29/30 met / mediana ≤56,915 s. Wynik nowego QR w grze nadal
oczekiwany. Nadzór pozostaje ACTIVE; pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono.

Poniższe sekcje zachowują wcześniejsze stany i dowody.

## Aktualny stan — QR-DQN dołączony po PPO, 5 października 12:05 Warsaw

Użytkownik polecił poprawić QR-DQN i dodać go do kolejki, następnie zezwolił
na późniejsze zakończenie testów, także po19:00, przed prawdziwymi treningami.
Poprawka QR jest opublikowana: **c4ec36a0b6d2eaf948c9eb24a783e344b81c1314**.
Nowy QR używa osobnego frozenruntime `tmrl-qr-repair-runtime`; aktualne
SD-SAC/PPO266e2629 oraz starsze runtime pozostają bez zmian.

Faktycznie dodany etap oczekujący: `queue-qr-repair-20261005`, launcher28636,
runner61196, status `waiting_for_predecessor`, bez kontrolera i bez `launch.json`.
`pending-queue.json` wskazuje QR; `active-queue.json` do zakończenia PPO wskazuje
bieżącą kolejkę SD-SAC/PPO. QR przejmie wskaźnik dopiero po wszystkich czterech
etapach, potwierdzonych wynikach, zamknięciu ich procesów/guardu i sprawdzeniu
wspólnej blokady. Nie uruchamia drugiego kontrolera ani nie ponawia poprzednika.

QR: świeży145408/seed17, max8100s, potem30greedy/max2700s. Nowa faza ma osobny
limit3h30 od faktycznego startu QR i SAVE10min przed HARD. Konkretne godziny
będą dopiero w QR `launch.json`/`effective-deadline.json`;16:29 pozostaje limitem
poprzedniej fazy. Jej prawidłowe zamknięcie nie kończy jeszcze autoryzowanego QR.
Nowy STOP, awaria lub niepełne PPO zatrzymują automatyczne przejęcie.

32testy źródeł +21testów CPU nadzoru i bramki przeszły, Ruff i mypy zmienionego
źródła przeszły. Pełna konfiguracja kompozycji QR64 przeszła standardowy validator
na CPU: syntetyczny update i zstd checkpoint roundtrip, bez gry, kontrolera i
nowego W&B. Bramka QR jest z góry: pełny/drained/finite/fingerprint/SHA pilot,
30ważnychprób/max100ms/noerrors/skips, >=29/30met i mediana<=56,915s. Wynik
jazdy nadal oczekiwany; matematyczna poprawka nie gwarantuje poprawy polityki.

Monitor ACTIVEco15min obejmuje również oczekujący QR. Raport końcowy i PAUSED
nastąpią po wszystkich autoryzowanych etapach lub ich zatrzymaniu/awarii/limicie.
Pełnych treningów nie uruchamiamy; QR, PPO i SD-SAC nie otrzymują deklaracji
optymalnych HP lub gotowości trzech seedów bez rzeczywistych wyników.

Stary fixturepoczątkowegoplanu odłożono: historyczna retencja usunęła cp659; jego nowy start jest zabroniony. Pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany, wspólna nagroda bez zmian, bez automatycznych miesięcznych treningów. Live wynik nowych poprawek jest jeszcze w toku.


## Zakończenie nocy i naprawy po przedłużeniu — 5 października

Nocna kolejka ukończyła wszystkie etapy 09:26:36 Warsaw; ostatni QR **26/30 met**,
mediana56,915s/średnia57,124s, max50ms, poprawny timing i brak błędów.
Użytkownik następnie przedłużył pracę poleceniem „Możesz robić dłużej niż do 10
 tylko spraw by PPO i DSAC poprawnie działało”. Wcześniejsze terminy są historią
zakończonej kolejki; nowe ograniczone testy mają własny jawny limit.
Reset nowego kodu zaliczony w grze; poprawki rozgrzewki/timingów PPO i stabilizacji
SD-SAC są testowane przed świeżymi pilotami. Pełny SD-SAC pozostaje zablokowany,
PPO zachowuje entropy0,01. Nagroda pozostaje wspólna; automatycznych miesięcznych

SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 bez zmian; pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono.

## TQC 30 prób — 5 października, 08:40 Europe/Warsaw

Zachowany stary cp33858 na runtime d0dfe645 ukończył ocenę:

## Powtarzalność IQN — 5 października, 08:11 Europe/Warsaw

Ocena zachowanego starego cp33854, na zamrożonym runtime d0dfe645, ukończona:
**29/30 met**, średnia ukończonych **49,452 s**, mediana **49,400 s**,

Nie zmieniamy IQN arbitralnie po dawnym wyniku 1/2: baseline pozostaje.
Pełne nowe starty nadal wymagają wspólnego nowego commita, kalibracji lokalnej,

Kampania nadal trwa, SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 bez zmian.

## Decyzja PPO — 5 października, 07:55 Europe/Warsaw

Porównanie obu wariantów zakończone na wspólnym cp70: **143 360 uczonych kroków /
70 aktualizacji**, pełne prefixy diagnostyczne, skończone checkpointy,
zgodność fingerprint i SHA potwierdzona. Pełnych miesięcznych treningów nie wykonano.

| Współczynnik entropii | Mety | Mediana ukończonych | Średnia ukończonych | Max/p99 kroku | Pominięte ramki |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0,01 baseline | 8/10 | 56,445 s | 56,585 s | 50/50 ms | 18 648 (max 6) |
| 0 | 7/10 | 57,880 s | 57,673 s | 50/50 ms | 18 173 (max 6) |

Wszystkie 20 prób mają ważny timing i brak błędów kontrolera/telemetrii.
Wariant 0 nie osiągnął minimum 8/10 met, miał niższy odsetek met oraz medianę
około 2,54% wolniejszą, zamiast wymaganych przynajmniej 5% poprawy.
**Zachowujemy baseline 0,01 w generatorze i pełnych konfiguracjach 17/29/43.**
Nie jest to dowód globalnej optymalności ani ukończenie końcowych 30 prób na seed.
Skoki race-clock treningu ponad 100 ms nadal stanowią ograniczenie lokalne.
Dowód decyzji: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/ppo-comparison-decision.json`.

Kampania trwa: istniejący runner rozpoczął 30 prób IQN 07:44:38 Warsaw.
SAVE 10:24 / HARD 10:34 bez zmian; pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany.

## PPO baseline — 5 października, 05:25 Europe/Warsaw

Świeży PPO entropy coefficient 0,01 zakończył krótki prefix diagnostyczny.
Do porównania wybrano potwierdzony, skończony cp70: **143 360 uczonych kroków,
70 aktualizacji**, processed_transitions=transitions; prefix_complete=true,
full_training_complete=false, wspólny harmonogram LR 2 048 000.
SHA256: `250767107f53a5917d9cc54fb8426539c8d234fd83a8dd01d09faf9bc8660bbb`.
Dziesięć prób greedy: **8/10 met**, średnia ukończonych 56,585 s,
mediana **56,445 s**, najlepsza 55,520 s. Dwie porażki przy około 81,20% postępu.
Wszystkie próby mają ważny timing; 11 068/11 068 pomiarów, max/p99 **50 ms**,
brak błędów kontrolera i telemetrii. Pominięte ramki: **18 648**, maksimum 6.
W treningu występowały skoki race-clock powyżej 100 ms (maksimum 530 ms);
poprawna ocena nie usuwa tego ograniczenia lokalnego treningu.
To wynik jednego seeda i 10 prób diagnostycznych, nie końcowe 30 prób na seed
ani dowód globalnej optymalności. Baseline 0,01 pozostaje ustawieniem domyślnym;
wybór 0 wymaga pełnego porównania zgodnego z ustalonym wcześniej protokołem.
Wariant entropy0 już działa od 05:21:32 Warsaw, W&B `yei92q7a`;
baseline `hymfpseo` potwierdzony finished. Kampania nadal trwa.
Dowody: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/ppo-baseline-completion.json` i
`tmrl-overnight-diag-ppo-baseline-s17-benchmark-20261005T031138975953/evaluation.json`.

## Wynik SD-SAC — 5 października, 03:10 Europe/Warsaw

Pilot celu entropii 2,0 / beta 0 zakończył **145 487 kroków / 33 871 aktualizacji**.
Końcowy cp33871 ma skończone tensory, zgodny fingerprint i rozliczony kredyt
**0,75** (`earned = accounted = 33 871,75`). Ocena zakończona: **0/10 met**,
postęp 4,24–5,17%, średnio 4,42%. Wszystkie pomiary czasu ważne, max/p99 50 ms,
brak błędów telemetrii/kontrolera; 651 pominiętych ramek, maksimum 5.
Warunek minimum 8/10 met NIE został spełniony: **pełny SD-SAC nadal zablokowany**,
hipoteza diagnostyczna nie zostaje promowana do konfiguracji seedów 17/29/43.
Poprawny zapis i sprawny pomiar nie oznaczają skutecznej polityki greedy.
Dowody: `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005/dsac-completion.json` oraz
`tmrl-overnight-diag-dsac-e200-b0-s17-benchmark-20261005T005546181914/evaluation.json`
w `artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison`. W&B trening `2fslk8zh`, ocena `vepn4pyj`.

To wynik częściowy kampanii. Świeży PPO baseline ruszył 02:58:36 Warsaw;
pozostałe etapy prowadzi istniejący runner. Nagroda i zamrożone runtime bez zmian.
Termin zapisu 10:24, twardy koniec 10:34 pozostają nadrzędne.


## Aktualizacja — 5 października, kampania nocna

Po wyraźnym wznowieniu użytkownika działa `queue-overnight-tuning-20261005`.
Budżet 10 godzin od początku pracy 00:34, zapis 10:24, twardy koniec 10:34 Warsaw.
Runner 37100 sam prowadzi etapy; nie uruchamiać kolejnego kontrolera ani pełnych
treningów. Poprzednie STOP pozostają dowodem, nowe STOP nadal zatrzymuje.
Aktualny plan i warunki doboru parametrów: [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Przydziały pozostają: Jakub IQN/QR, Borys SD-SAC, Kamil TQC, Kuba P. PPO,
SAC bez przydziału. Pełne trzy seedy dopiero z końcowego wspólnego commita,
od zera, po lokalnej kalibracji i smoke; nie wznawiać pilotów na nowym kodzie.

## Historia: kolejka z 4 października 17:28, zatrzymana na polecenie użytkownika

Kod zespołu opublikowany na obu branchach: **8f440075**. Nowy pilot korzysta
z osobnego, czystego i zamrożonego `tmrl-tuning-runtime` na tym commicie.
Stare IQN/PPO będą oceniane na zachowanym `tmrl-algorithm-runs` (`d0dfe645`,
źródła Python `378f9c6a`), bez przenoszenia checkpointów między wersjami.

Kolejka `queue-tuning-20261004` wystartowała **17:27:56 Europe/Warsaw**.
Termin zapisu **20:17:56**, twardy koniec **20:27:56**. To zatwierdzone nowe
3 godziny łącznie, nie przedłużanie poprzedniej kampanii. Wskaźnik
`artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/active-queue.json` wskazuje tę kolejkę.
SD-SAC `tmrl-tuning-dsac-entropy200-beta000-s17` działa, W&B
[o3aknhmz](https://wandb.ai/dsc-pjatk-warsaw/my-trackmania-agent/runs/o3aknhmz)
potwierdzony online/running. O 17:30 zapisano 1943 kroki w fazie warmup,
ważny timing ostatniego epizodu (p99 50 ms, max 60 ms), brak błędu telemetrii.
To kontrola uruchomienia, nie wynik uczenia ani kwalifikacja SD-SAC.

Następnie planowane są 10 ocen SD-SAC, 10 IQN i 5 PPO w pozostałym czasie.
Warunki promocji SD-SAC oraz sprawdzone ustawienia opisuje [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Monitor działa co 5 minut i ma zakończyć pracę po raporcie tej kampanii.
Pełnych treningów nie uruchomiono. Końcowy dobór SD-SAC pozostaje otwarty do
wyniku jazdy; jego pełne uruchomienia są nadal zablokowane.


## Nowe przygotowanie i testy — 2026-10-04 po 17:00

Po zakończeniu poprzedniej kampanii użytkownik zatwierdził naprawy oraz
**do 3 godzin łącznie nowych testów w grze**. Aktualne decyzje o parametrach,
kolejność prób, poprawki PPO i warunki wyboru SD-SAC opisuje [TUNING.md](TUNING.md).
Pełne treningi pozostają ręczne; SD-SAC nadal jest zablokowany do wyniku nowego
pilota. Stare checkpointy zachowują swój zamrożony runtime. Poniższy raport
15:41 i starsze sekcje dokumentują zakończoną poprzednią kampanię, nie nową kolejkę.

## Kampania zakończona — 2026-10-04, 15:41 Europe/Warsaw

Wszystkie zaplanowane piloty i krótkie ewaluacje zakończone. TQC, QR, PPO
oraz continuous SAC mają pozytywne piloty; IQN ukończył 1/2 przejazdów i
wymaga dalszej kontroli stabilności. SD-SAC pozostaje niegotowy. Pełnych
treningów nie uruchomiono automatycznie. Wyniki, timing i ograniczenia:
[READINESS.md](READINESS.md).

| Osoba | Algorytm | Warunki pełnych treningów |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jakub | IQN i QR | każdy: 17/29/43, lokalny smoke; IQN stabilność do sprawdzenia |
| Borys | discrete SAC | zablokowane; najpierw pilot 2,0 / beta 0 i wybór ustawień |
| Kamil | TQC | 17/29/43 po lokalnej kalibracji i smoke |
| Kuba P. | PPO | 17/29/43 po lokalnym smoke i kontroli timingu |
| Bez przydziału | continuous SAC | 17/29/43 po lokalnym smoke; ręczny start odblokowany |

Aktualna decyzja przed pełnym startem: [READINESS.md](READINESS.md).
Launcher blokuje pełne SD-SAC do czasu pozytywnego testu niższej entropii. Dla Borysa przygotowano
wyłącznie test: `run_assigned.ps1 sd-sac -Pilot` (145 408 kroków, seed 17,
cel entropii 2,0, kara 0,0). Po nim potrzebna osobna ewaluacja bez eksploracji;
skrypt nie przechodzi automatycznie do pełnych seedów.
IQN i QR zakończyły kampanię v2; nie powtarzać ich automatycznie.
Discrete SAC bez kary entropii zakończył pilot, lecz ewaluacja
dała 0/3 ukończeń (postęp 78,9%, 5,4%, 5,4%). **Borys: pełne treningi jeszcze
nie są gotowe do startu.** Przygotowano osobny, nieuruchomiony test celu
entropii 2,0; instrukcję i ograniczenia opisuje READINESS.md.
**Kamil / TQC: pilot v2 zakończony pozytywnie**, 145 433 kroki, 71/181 met
w treningu i 2/2 w krótkiej ewaluacji (45,24 s; 44,06 s). Hiperparametry
pozostają bez zmian; przed pełnym startem wymagany lokalny test i kalibracja.
**Kuba P. / PPO: ukończony pilot**, 145 408 kroków, 13 met w pełnych śladach
treningu i 2/2 w ewaluacji (58,27 s; 59,13 s). Zachowujemy baseline; przed
pełnym startem lokalny test oraz kontrola pojedynczego odstępu 140 ms.
Audyt i ograniczenia: [ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md](ALGORITHM_AUDIT.md).
**Continuous SAC: 145 416 kroków, 83/198 met, ostatnie 20/20**, ewaluacja
2/2 (43,78 s; 44,75 s), max/p99 50 ms, bez błędów. Baseline bez zmian;
nie ma jeszcze przydzielonej osoby. Dwa przejazdy nie zastępują 30 prób/seed.
Końcowy stan kolejki opisuje [NIGHT_QUEUE.md](NIGHT_QUEUE.md).
Pełnych treningów nie
uruchamiamy automatycznie po pilotach. Przed przekazaniem do długich prób
sprawdzamy każdy algorytm: aktualizacje o skończonym lossie, zmiana polityki,
ukończony budżet, poprawny zapis końcowego checkpointu, metryki w W&B,
stabilne sterowanie i brak błędów telemetryki. Pilot nie musi ukończyć mapy,
ale sam działający proces nie jest jeszcze pozytywnym wynikiem testu.

Bezpośredni reset poprawionego nowego kodu sprawdzono lokalnie po zamknięciu
kolejki: zgodny UID, telemetria i zegar 10 ms; klient i kontroler zamknięte.
To nie zastępuje lokalnego smoke jazdy na komputerze każdej osoby. Wszyscy
używają jednego nowego commita obu branchy i zapisują hash; pełny start
od zera. Stary zamrożony checkout służy tylko starym checkpointom.

## Instalacja u kolegi

Użyj brancha `codex/tmrl-algorithm-runs` w osobnym katalogu. Jest to snapshot bieżącego
kodu wraz z lokalnymi zmianami; używaj tego samego commita u wszystkich.
Nie podmieniaj go na wersję biblioteki z PyPI. Wymagany Windows, GPU NVIDIA
ze sterownikiem zgodnym z dołączonym środowiskiem CUDA, Trackmania i Openplanet.

```powershell
git clone --branch codex/tmrl-algorithm-runs https://github.com/TrackmaniaRL/TrackmaniaRL.git
cd TrackmaniaRL
```

1. Zainstaluj uv, a w katalogu repozytorium wykonaj `uv sync --group dev`.
2. Skonfiguruj Openplanet School Mode, plugin TrackmaniaRL Connect / SAC_GetData
   i wirtualny gamepad zgodnie z `readme/trackmania.md`.
3. Otwórz dołączoną mapę `my-trackmania-agent/maps/trackmaniarl-test.Map.Gbx`
   w edytorze w trybie walidacji. Geometria jest już w paczce.
4. Utwórz własny prywatny `.env` z `WANDB_API_KEY=twoj_klucz`.
   Branch nie zawiera klucza Jakuba. Konto musi mieć dostęp do projektu zespołu.
5. Ustaw w PowerShell `$env:WANDB_ENTITY = 'dsc-pjatk-warsaw'`.
   Jeśli nie masz dostępu, ustal go z Jakubem przed startem.
6. Sprawdź CUDA: `uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`.
   Wynik musi być `True` dla tych konfiguracji.
7. Sprawdź połączenie: `uv run trackmaniarl track check` oraz test bez gry:
   `uv run python -m experiments.tmrl_test_comparison.check`.
8. Bez działającego treningu, na załadowanej mapie zmierz lokalne sterowanie:
   `uv run trackmaniarl track check-steering --output artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/steering-local.json`.
   Konfiguracje wymagają tego pliku. Nie kopiuj krzywej innej osoby; po zmianie
   ustawień kontrolera zmierz ją ponownie. Patrz [NIGHT_QUEUE.md](NIGHT_QUEUE.md).

Launcher przed każdym seedem sprawdza UID, restartuje walidację i wymaga
gotowego gracza oraz telemetrii. Kończy ten kontroler przed startem treningu;
nie uruchamiaj go obok innej jazdy. Chroni to przed brakiem ramek na ekranie
wyniku poprzedniego seeda. Błąd sprawdzenia zatrzymuje kolejkę.
Launcher sprawdza także działające procesy treningu i ewaluacji oraz odmawia
startu, jeśli katalog runu już istnieje. Wznowienie checkpointu wymaga osobnego
polecenia; ponowne uruchomienie launchera nie nadpisuje istniejącej próby.
Tryb `-Pilot` uruchamia tylko seed 17 z budżetem pilota, zwykle około 2–3 h
plus restarty i uczenie; nie ma twardego limitu czasu ściennego.

Po pozytywnym lokalnym pilocie przypisanego algorytmu uruchom **jedno** polecenie:

```powershell
# Kamil:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File experiments/tmrl_test_comparison/run_assigned.ps1 tqc
# Kuba P.:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File experiments/tmrl_test_comparison/run_assigned.ps1 ppo
# Operator continuous SAC, dopiero po lokalnym smoke i kalibracji:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File experiments/tmrl_test_comparison/run_assigned.ps1 sac
```

Każde polecenie wykonuje trzy seedy kolejno, od zera. Nie uruchamiaj dwóch
algorytmów naraz na jednej instancji gry. IQN i QR u Jakuba mają analogiczne
polecenia. Bezpieczne zatrzymanie: utwórz plik `artifacts/STOP-NAZWA_ALGORYTMU`.
Ponowne wykonanie skryptu nie wznawia checkpointów i zatrzyma się na istniejącym
katalogu runu. Po przerwaniu wznów konkretny seed według protokołu.

## Co zwrócić

Linki do trzech runów W&B oraz foldery tych runów z `artifacts/tmrl-test-comparison/`,
w tym checkpointy, manifesty i JSONL. Zachowaj hash commita, model GPU/CPU,
wersję sterownika, FPS gry i ustawienia grafiki. Sprzęt i obciążenie gry mogą
zmieniać timing sterowania, więc sprawdzamy rozkład odstępów decyzji na każdym
komputerze. Nie porównuj samego czasu ściennego bez informacji o sprzęcie.

Ocena końcowych checkpointów: 30 przejazdów według `README.md`, osobno dla
każdego seeda; najlepiej wszystkie checkpointy ocenić później na jednym komputerze.
W&B jest wspólnym podglądem metryk, lokalne pliki zachowują pełny zapis próby.
