# Troubleshooting

Start with `trackmaniarl validate run.yaml`, then `trackmaniarl track check
--config run.yaml` with the car ready on the intended map. Run `smoke` before a
long training job. Keep the error message, resolved configuration and local logs.

| Symptom | Check and remedy |
| --- | --- |
| No telemetry / connection refused | Confirm the managed plugin is enabled, the game is running and TCP 9000/9001 match the config. Do not run duplicate loose and managed plugins. Check local firewall rules. |
| Protocol or frame-width mismatch | The library expects session protocol 2 and exactly 33 telemetry fields. Check plugin version/source, do not pad or truncate packets. |
| Menu opens and car does not move | Return to editor validation, reset the car and verify that restart controls reset the race clock. School Mode does not permit normal online play. Use the documented finish-confirmation setting for editor validation. |
| Plugin in wrong mode | Enable Openplanet School Mode and use editor validation. Verify the managed plugin in Plugin Manager, not just a copied script. |
| Map UID/hash mismatch | Load the intended local map, rebuild geometry for that exact file and update environment, features and evaluation UID together. The generated geometry is only a placeholder. |
| Skipped telemetry frames | Producer skips and long race-clock steps are different metrics. Reduce competing CPU work, rendering load and recording resolution, check decision cadence and controller timing. Compare fresh complete series. Never remove the slow/skipped attempts to improve the mean. |
| Benchmark gate fails despite finishes | Inspect all trials and configured targets. `--reject-telemetry-skips` rejects the complete series on any skip. Targets are strict for lap time, the maximum step-clock bound is inclusive. |
| No finishes | Inspect failure reasons and progress bins. Verify geometry order, finish extension/gate, speed units and maximum episode duration. Allow time to recover from collisions, check repeated brake actions and demo cadence before changing the model. |
| GPU unused | Check the installed Torch build and learner execution device. CPU-bound game collection can keep a working GPU lightly loaded. See the performance guide before raising update frequency. |
| CUDA unavailable / CPU-only host | Choose the appropriate official Torch wheel before syncing a generated project, its default source is CUDA 12.8. `device: cpu` cannot repair a missing library/driver dependency. |
| Missing W&B credentials | Use the default local JSONL logger, or install/configure the optional W&B integration deliberately. |
| Recorder fails / black recording | Install FFmpeg, check window title, keep Trackmania visible and unminimized. Inspect the `.ffmpeg.log`, recording failure makes the command fail. Run a short recording check before a 30-trial capture. |
| Resume rejects the checkpoint | Check schema 2.0, model architecture, immutable configuration and journal identity. Use a full training checkpoint for exact resume. Warm-start a new run if intentionally changing architecture, with an explicit compatible transfer. |

## Camera and PPO

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Missing `mss` at live startup | Install `trackmaniarl[vision]`. Synthetic validation does not require desktop capture. |
| Camera observes a menu, desktop or black area | Set `environment.kwargs.capture` to the visible game viewport. Keep the window unminimized and unobstructed. Check display permissions and backend support. |
| Image channel mismatch | Match `VisionPpoModelFactory.kwargs.channels` to `frame_stack` times 1 for grayscale or 3 for RGB. Run `validate` after changing either component. |
| Vision training exhausts RAM or VRAM | Reduce image dimensions, rollout length and replay capacity together. Reduce optimizer minibatch size for activation memory. Keep capacity at least as large as a rollout. |
| PPO rejects sampler or n-step settings | Use `OnPolicySequenceSampler` and `n_step: 1`. Off-policy replay sampling cannot replace a fresh behavior-policy rollout. |
| PPO rejects the transition budget | `total_transitions` must be divisible by `sequence_length`. |
| PPO cannot run through `learner` or `actor` | Use local `train`, `smoke`, `resume` and `benchmark`. Distributed PPO is not implemented. |
| Camera demonstration loading fails | Existing telemetry demonstration archives have no image frames. Use live image collection or an environment supplying recorded RGB transitions through the SDK. |
| Restart changes the camera policy's first actions | Image history is reset and padded with the first frame. A checkpoint restores learning state, not an active game session. |

The library cannot guarantee that a map is learnable with the default reward or
that a model reaches a particular time. Compare finish rate, complete attempt
distribution, training/evaluation policy mode and telemetry before attributing
poor performance to hardware or architecture.
