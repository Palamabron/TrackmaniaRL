# TrackmaniaRL 1.2.4 documentation

The package version is 1.2.4. Configuration and checkpoint schemas are 2.0.
These numbers describe different contracts. Historical benchmark and review pages
retain the versions and dates of the runs they describe.

## From setup to an evaluated policy

1. Follow [installation and game setup](../README.md) and
   [Trackmania integration](trackmania.md) to connect Openplanet, configure control
   input, identify the map and build its geometry.
2. Choose an [algorithm and supported model combination](algorithms.md).
   Generated `run.yaml` uses IQN/lidar, `run-ppo.yaml` uses PPO/telemetry, and
   `run-ppo-vision.yaml` uses PPO/camera. The [vision guide](vision.md) explains
   capture, frame stacking, CNNs, GAE and PPO optimization.
3. Use the [configuration reference](configuration.md) to set components, rollout
   or replay settings, execution device and evaluation rules. Run `validate` for a
   synthetic learner update and checkpoint round trip, then `smoke` with the game.
4. Read [library data flow](../docs/library-architecture.md) and
   [runtime architecture](architecture.md) to understand how observations become
   actions, transitions and learning batches. [Replay and sequences](replay-and-sequences.md)
   explains n-step targets, terminal masks, PER, recurrent history and fresh PPO rollouts.
5. Inspect [reward construction](../docs/reward-function.md) and
   [metrics](observability.md) while training. Use [performance](performance.md)
   and [troubleshooting](../docs/troubleshooting.md) to distinguish learning problems
   from capture, telemetry, controller or device problems.
6. Resume with a full training checkpoint using the [checkpoint lifecycle](sdk.md).
   Evaluate with `benchmark`, keeping every attempt, finish rate, finish times and
   telemetry quality. [Recording](../docs/recording.md) explains optional video evidence.

## Extending and maintaining the library

The [Python SDK](sdk.md) documents public contracts, component factories, PyTrees,
model composition and checkpoint handling. [Imitation learning](imitation-learning.md)
covers demonstration recording, BC, DAgger and recovery workflows.
[Development](development.md) covers adding components, tests and release checks.
The [support matrix](../docs/support-status.md) describes supported paths and their contracts.

Tests establish component and workflow behavior. Racing results require live
experiments. Camera capture uses a visible desktop viewport and does not provide
an atomic image/telemetry snapshot. PPO is supported locally, while distributed
learner/actor execution is an off-policy workflow.
